BALDRS DRAUMAR
Baldr's Dreams
<END PAGE>
1. Once were the gods |
together met,
And the goddesses
came | and council held,
And the far-famed
ones | the truth would
find,
Why baleful dreams | to
Baldr had come.

<END PAGE>
2. Then Othin rose, |
the enchanter old,
And the saddle he laid |
on Sleipnir's back;
Thence rode he down |
to Niflhel deep,
And the hound he met |
that came from hell.

<END PAGE>
3. Bloody he was | on
his breast before,
At the father of magic |
he howled from afar;
Forward rode Othin, |
the earth resounded
Till the house so high |
of Hel he reached.

<END PAGE>
4. Then Othin rode | to
the eastern door,
There, he knew well, |
was the wise-woman's
grave;
Magic he spoke | and
mighty charms,
Till spell-bound she
rose, | and in death
she spoke:

5. "What is the man, | to
me unknown,
That has made me
travel | the troublous
road?
I was snowed on with
snow, | and smitten with
rain,
And drenched with dew;
| long was I dead."

<END PAGE>
Othin spake:
6. "Vegtam my name, | I
am Valtam's son;
Speak thou of hell, |
for of heaven I know:
For whom are the
benches | bright with
rings,
And the platforms gay |
bedecked with gold?"

<END PAGE>
The Wise-Woman spake:
7. "Here for Baldr |
the mead is brewed,
The shining drink, | and
a shield lies o'er it;
But their hope is gone |
from the mighty gods.
Unwilling I spake, | and
now would be still."

<END PAGE>
Othin spake:
8. "Wise-woman, cease
not! | I seek from thee
All to know | that I fain
would ask:
Who shall the bane | of
Baldr become,
And steal the life |
from Othin's son?"

<END PAGE>
The Wise-Woman spake:
9. "Hoth thither bears |
the far-famed branch,
He shall the bane | of
Baldr become,
And steal the life |
from Othin's son.
Unwilling I spake, | and
now would be still."

<END PAGE>
Othin spake:
10. "Wise-woman, cease
not! | I seek from thee
All to know | that I fain
would ask:
Who shall vengeance
win | for the evil work,
Or bring to the flames |
the slayer of Baldr?"

<END PAGE>
The Wise-Woman spake:
11. "Rind bears Vali | in
Vestrsalir,
And one night old |
fights Othin's son;
His hands he shall
wash not, | his hair he
shall comb not,
Till the slayer of Baldr
| he brings to the
flames.
<END PAGE>
Unwilling I spake, | and
now would be still."

Othin spake:
12. "Wise-woman, cease
not! | I seek from thee
All to know | that I fain
would ask:
What maidens are they |
who then shall weep,
And toss to the sky |
the yards of the
sails?"
<END PAGE>
The Wise-Woman spake:
13. "Vegtam thou art
not, | as erstwhile I
thought;
Othin thou art, | the
enchanter old."

Othin spake:
No wise-woman art
thou, | nor wisdom hast;
Of giants three | the
mother art thou.
