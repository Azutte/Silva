HELREITH BRYNHILDAR
Brynhild's Hell-Ride
<END PAGE>
1. "Thou shalt not
further | forward
fare,
My dwelling ribbed | with
rocks across;
More seemly it were |
at thy weaving to stay,
Than another's
husband | here to
follow.

2. "What wouldst thou
have | from Valland
here,
Fickle of heart, | in this
my house?
Gold-goddess, now, | if
thou wouldst know,
Heroes' blood | from
thy hands hast
washed."

<END PAGE>
Brynhild spake:
3. "Chide me not, woman
| from rocky walls,
Though to battle once |
I was wont to go;
Better than thou | I
shall seem to be,
When men us two | shall
truly know."

<END PAGE>
The giantess spake:
4. "Thou wast, Brynhild,
| Buthli's daughter,
For the worst of evils |
born in the world;
To death thou hast
given | Gjuki's children,
And laid their lofty |
house full low."

<END PAGE>
Brynhild spake:
5. "Truth from the
wagon | here I tell
thee,
Witless one, | if know
thou wilt
How the heirs of Gjuki |
gave me to be
joyless ever, | a
breaker of oaths.

6. "Hild the helmed | in
Hlymdalir
They named me of old, |
all they who knew me.
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

7. "The monarch bold |
the swan-robes bore
Of the sisters eight |
beneath an oak;
<END PAGE>
Twelve winters I was, |
if know thou wilt,
When oaths I yielded |
the king so young.

8. "Next I let | the
leader of Goths,
Hjalmgunnar the old, |
go down to hell,
And victory brought |
to Autha's brother;
<END PAGE>
For this was Othin's |
anger mighty.

9. "He beset me with
shields | in Skatalund,
Red and white, | their
rims o'erlapped;
He bade that my sleep |
should broken be
By him who fear | had
nowhere found.
<END PAGE>
10. "He let round my
hall, | that southward
looked,
The branches' foe |
high-leaping burn;
Across it he bade | the
hero come
Who brought me the
gold | that Fafnir
guarded

<END PAGE>
11. On Grani rode | the
giver of gold,
Where my
foster-father | ruled
his folk;
Best of all | he seemed
to be,
The prince of the
Danes, | when the
people met.

12. "Happy we slept, |
one bed we had,
As he my brother |
born had been;
Eight were the nights |
when neither there
Loving hand | on the
other laid.

<END PAGE>
13. "Yet Guthrun
reproached me, |
Gjuki's daughter,
That I in Sigurth's |
arms had slept;
Then did I hear | what I
would were hid,
That they had
betrayed me | in taking
a mate.
