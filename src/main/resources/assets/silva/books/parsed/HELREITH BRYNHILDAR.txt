HELREITH BRYNHILDAR
Brynhild's Hell-Ride
<END PAGE>
1. "Thou shalt not
further | forward
fare,
My dwelling ribbed | with
rocks across;
More seemly it were |
<END PAGE>
at thy weaving to stay,
Than another's
husband | here to
follow.

<END PAGE>
2. "What wouldst thou
have | from Valland
here,
Fickle of heart, | in this
my house?
Gold-goddess, now, | if
<END PAGE>
thou wouldst know,
Heroes' blood | from
thy hands hast
washed."

<END PAGE>
Brynhild spake:
3. "Chide me not, woman
| from rocky walls,
Though to battle once |
I was wont to go;
Better than thou | I
<END PAGE>
shall seem to be,
When men us two | shall
truly know."

The giantess spake:
4. "Thou wast, Brynhild,
<END PAGE>
| Buthli's daughter,
For the worst of evils |
born in the world;
To death thou hast
given | Gjuki's children,
And laid their lofty |
<END PAGE>
house full low."

Brynhild spake:
5. "Truth from the
wagon | here I tell
thee,
<END PAGE>
Witless one, | if know
thou wilt
How the heirs of Gjuki |
gave me to be
joyless ever, | a
<END PAGE>
breaker of oaths.

6. "Hild the helmed | in
Hlymdalir
They named me of old, |
all they who knew me.
<END PAGE>
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

7. "The monarch bold |
the swan-robes bore
Of the sisters eight |
<END PAGE>
beneath an oak;
Twelve winters I was, |
if know thou wilt,
When oaths I yielded |
the king so young.

<END PAGE>
8. "Next I let | the
leader of Goths,
Hjalmgunnar the old, |
go down to hell,
And victory brought |
<END PAGE>
to Autha's brother;
For this was Othin's |
anger mighty.

9. "He beset me with
shields | in Skatalund,
<END PAGE>
Red and white, | their
rims o'erlapped;
He bade that my sleep |
should broken be
By him who fear | had
<END PAGE>
nowhere found.

10. "He let round my
hall, | that southward
looked,
The branches' foe |
<END PAGE>
high-leaping burn;
Across it he bade | the
hero come
Who brought me the
gold | that Fafnir
guarded
<END PAGE>
11. On Grani rode | the
giver of gold,
Where my
foster-father | ruled
his folk;
Best of all | he seemed
<END PAGE>
to be,
The prince of the
Danes, | when the
people met.

<END PAGE>
12. "Happy we slept, |
one bed we had,
As he my brother |
born had been;
Eight were the nights |
<END PAGE>
when neither there
Loving hand | on the
other laid.

13. "Yet Guthrun
<END PAGE>
reproached me, |
Gjuki's daughter,
That I in Sigurth's |
arms had slept;
Then did I hear | what I
would were hid,
That they had
<END PAGE>
betrayed me | in taking
a mate.

14. "Ever with grief |
and all too long
Are men and women |
