HYNDLULJOTH
The Poem of Hyndla
<END PAGE>
1. "Maiden, awake! |
wake thee, my friend,
My sister Hyndla, | in
thy hollow cave!
Already comes
<END PAGE>
darkness, | and ride
must we
To Valhall to seek | the
sacred hall.

2. "The favor of
<END PAGE>
Heerfather | seek we
to find,
To his followers gold |
he gladly gives;
To Hermoth gave he |
helm and mail-coat,
And to Sigmund he gave
<END PAGE>
| a sword as gift.

3. "Triumph to some, |
and treasure to
others,
To many wisdom | and
<END PAGE>
skill in words,
Fair winds to the
sailor, | to the singer
his art,
And a manly heart | to
many a hero.
<END PAGE>
4. "Thor shall I honor,
| and this shall I ask,
That his favor true |
mayst thou ever find;
. . . . . . . . . .
Though little the brides
<END PAGE>
| of the giants he
loves.

5. "From the stall now |
one of thy wolves lead
forth,
And along with my boar
<END PAGE>
| shalt thou let him run;
For slow my boar goes
| on the road of the
gods,
And I would not weary |
my worthy steed."
<END PAGE>
Hyndla spake:
6. "Falsely thou askest
me, | Freyja, to go,
For so in the glance |
of thine eyes I see;
On the way of the slain
<END PAGE>
| thy lover goes with
thee.
Ottar the young, | the
son of Instein."

Freyja spake:
7. "Wild dreams,
<END PAGE>
methinks, | are thine
when thou sayest
My lover is with me | on
the way of the slain;
There shines the boar
| with bristles of gold,
Hildisvini, | he who was
<END PAGE>
made
By Dain and Nabbi, | the
cunning dwarfs.

8. "Now let us down |
from our saddles leap,
<END PAGE>
And talk of the race |
of the heroes twain;
The men who were born
| of the gods above,
. . . . . . . . . .

<END PAGE>
9. "A wager have made
| in the foreign metal
Ottar the young | and
Angantyr;
We must guard, for the
<END PAGE>
hero | young to have,
His father's wealth, |
the fruits of his race.

10. "For me a shrine |
of stones he made,--
<END PAGE>
And now to glass | the
rock has grown;--
Oft with the blood | of
beasts was it red;
In the goddesses ever
<END PAGE>
| did Ottar trust.

11. "Tell to me now |
the ancient names,
And the races of all |
that were born of old:
<END PAGE>
Who are of the
Skjoldungs, | who of
the Skilfings,
Who of the Othlings, |
who of the Ylfings,
Who are the
<END PAGE>
free-born, | who are
the high-born,
The noblest of men |
that in Mithgarth
dwell?"

<END PAGE>
Hyndla spake:
12. "Thou art, Ottar, |
the son of Instein,
And Instein the son |
of Alf the Old,
Alf of Ulf, | Ulf of
<END PAGE>
Sæfari,
And Sæfari's father |
was Svan the Red.

13. "Thy mother, bright
| with bracelets fair,
<END PAGE>
Hight, methinks, | the
priestess Hledis;
Frothi her father, |
and Friaut her
mother;--
Her race of the
<END PAGE>
mightiest | men must
seem.

14. "Of old the noblest
| of all was Ali,
Before him Halfdan, |
<END PAGE>
foremost of
Skjoldungs;
Famed were the battles
| the hero fought,
To the corners of
heaven | his deeds
<END PAGE>
were carried.

15. "Strengthened by
Eymund, | the strongest
of men,
Sigtrygg he slew | with
<END PAGE>
the ice-cold sword;
His bride was Almveig, |
the best of women,
And eighteen boys | did
Almveig bear him.

<END PAGE>
16. "Hence come the
Skjoldungs, | hence the
Skilfings,
Hence the Othlings, |
hence the Ynglings,
Hence come the
<END PAGE>
free-born, | hence the
high-born,
The noblest of men |
that in Mithgarth dwell:
And all are thy
kinsmen, | Ottar, thou
<END PAGE>
fool!

17. "Hildigun then | her
mother hight,
The daughter of Svava
| and Sækonung;
<END PAGE>
And all are thy
kinsmen, | Ottar, thou
fool!
It is much to know,-- |
wilt thou hear yet
<END PAGE>
more?

18. "The mate of Dag |
was a mother of
heroes,
Thora, who bore him |
<END PAGE>
the bravest of
fighters,
Frathmar and Gyrth |
and the Frekis twain,
Am and Jofurmar, | Alf
the Old;
It is much to know,-- |
<END PAGE>
wilt thou hear yet
more?

19. "Her husband was
Ketil, | the heir of
Klypp,
He was of thy mother |
<END PAGE>
the mother's-father;
Before the days | of
Kari was Frothi,
And horn of Hild | was
Hoalf then.

<END PAGE>
20. "Next was Nanna, |
daughter of Nokkvi,
Thy father's kinsman |
her son became;
Old is the line, | and
<END PAGE>
longer still,
And all are thy
kinsmen, | Ottar, thou
fool!

<END PAGE>
21. "Isolf and Osolf, |
the sons of Olmoth,
Whose wife was
Skurhild, | the daughter
of Skekkil,
Count them among | the
<END PAGE>
heroes mighty,
And all are thy
kinsmen, | Ottar, thou
fool!

<END PAGE>
22. "Gunnar the
Bulwark, | Grim the
Hardy,
Thorir the Iron-shield,
| Ulf the Gaper,
Brodd and Hörvir |
<END PAGE>
both did I know;
In the household they
were | of Hrolf the Old.

23. "Hervarth,
<END PAGE>
Hjorvarth, | Hrani,
Angantyr,
Bui and Brami, | Barri
and Reifnir,
Tind and Tyrfing, | the
Haddings twain,--
And all are thy
<END PAGE>
kinsmen, | Ottar, thou
fool!

24. "Eastward in Bolm |
were born of old
The sons of Arngrim |
<END PAGE>
and Eyfura;
With berserk-tumult |
and baleful deed
Like fire o'er land |
and sea they fared,
And all are thy
<END PAGE>
kinsmen, | Ottar, thou
fool!

25. "The sons of
Jormunrek | all of yore
To the gods in death |
<END PAGE>
were as offerings
given;
He was kinsman of
Sigurth,-- | hear well
what I say,--
The foe of hosts, | and
<END PAGE>
Fafnir's slayer.

26., "From Volsung's
seed | was the hero
sprung,
And Hjordis was born |
<END PAGE>
of Hrauthung's race,
And Eylimi | from the
Othlings came,--
And all are thy
kinsmen, | Ottar, thou
fool!
<END PAGE>
27. "Gunnar and Hogni,
| the heirs of Gjuki,
And Guthrun as well, |
who their sister was;
But Gotthorm was not |
<END PAGE>
of Gjuki's race,
Although the brother |
of both he was:
And all are thy
kinsmen, | Ottar, thou
fool!
<END PAGE>
28. "Of Hvethna's sons
| was Haki the best,
And Hjorvarth the
father | of Hvethna
was;
. . . . . . . . . .
<END PAGE>
29. "Harald
Battle-tooth | of Auth
was born,
Hrörek the Ring-giver
| her husband was;
Auth the Deep-minded |
<END PAGE>
was Ivar's daughter,
But Rathbarth the
father | of Randver
was:
And all are thy
<END PAGE>
kinsmen, | Ottar, thou
fool!"

Fragment of "The
Short Voluspo"

<END PAGE>
30. Eleven in number |
the gods were known,
When Baldr o'er the hill
| of death was bowed;
And this to avenge |
<END PAGE>
was Vali swift,
When his brother's
slayer | soon he slew.

31. The father of
<END PAGE>
Baldr | was the heir of
Bur,
. . . . . . . . . .

32. Freyr's wife was
Gerth, | the daughter
<END PAGE>
of Gymir,
Of the giants' brood, |
and Aurbotha bore
her;
To these as well | was
Thjazi kin,
<END PAGE>
The dark-loving giant; |
his daughter was
Skathi.

33. Much have I told
<END PAGE>
thee, | and further will
tell;
There is much that I
know;-- | wilt thou hear
yet more?

<END PAGE>
34. Heith and
Hrossthjof, | the
children of Hrimnir.
. . . . . . . . . .

<END PAGE>
35. The sybils arose |
from Vitholf's race,
From Vilmeith all | the
seers are,
And the workers of
<END PAGE>
charms | are
Svarthofthi's children,
And from Ymir sprang |
the giants all.

36. Much have I told
<END PAGE>
thee, | and further will
tell;
There is much that I
know;-- | wilt thou hear
yet more?

<END PAGE>
37. One there was born
| in the bygone days,
Of the race of the
gods, | and great was
his might;
Nine giant women, | at
<END PAGE>
the world's edge,
Once bore the man | so
mighty in arms.

38. Gjolp there bore
<END PAGE>
him, | Greip there bore
him,
Eistla bore him, | and
Eyrgjafa,
Ulfrun bore him, | and
Angeyja,
Imth and Atla, | and
<END PAGE>
Jarnsaxa.

39. Strong was he made
| with the strength of
earth,
With the ice-cold sea, |
<END PAGE>
and the blood of swine.

40. One there was
born, | the best of all,
And strong was he
<END PAGE>
made | with the
strength of earth;
The proudest is called
| the kinsman of men
Of the rulers all |
throughout the world.

<END PAGE>
41. Much have I told
thee, | and further will
tell;
There is much that I
know;-- | wilt thou hear
<END PAGE>
yet more?

42. The wolf did Loki |
with Angrbotha win,
And Sleipnir bore he |
to Svathilfari;
<END PAGE>
The worst of marvels |
seemed the one
That sprang from the
brother | of Byleist
then.

<END PAGE>
43. A heart ate Loki,--
| in the embers it lay,
And half-cooked found
he | the woman's
heart;--
With child from the
<END PAGE>
woman | Lopt soon was,
And thence among men |
came the monsters all.

44. The sea,
<END PAGE>
storm-driven, | seeks
heaven itself,
O'er the earth it flows,
| the air grows sterile;
Then follow the snows |
and the furious winds,
For the gods are
<END PAGE>
doomed, | and the end
is death.

45. Then comes
another, | a greater
than all,
Though never I dare |
<END PAGE>
his name to speak;
Few are they now | that
farther can see
Than the moment when
Othin | shall meet the
wolf.
<END PAGE>

Freyja spake:
46. "To my boar now
bring | the
<END PAGE>
memory-beer,
So that all thy words, |
that well thou hast
spoken,
The third morn hence |
he may hold in mind,
<END PAGE>
When their races Ottar
| and Angantyr tell."

Hyndla spake:
47. "Hence shalt thou
<END PAGE>
fare, | for fain would I
sleep,
From me thou gettest |
few favors good;
My noble one, out | in
the night thou leapest
As. Heithrun goes | the
<END PAGE>
goats among.

48. "To Oth didst thou
run, | who loved thee
ever,
And many under | thy
<END PAGE>
apron have crawled;
My noble one, out | in
the night thou leapest,
As Heithrun goes | the
goats among."

<END PAGE>
Freyja spake:
49. "Around the
giantess | flames shall
I raise,
So that forth
<END PAGE>
unburned | thou mayst
not fare."

Hyndla spake:
50. "Flames I see
burning, | the earth is
<END PAGE>
on fire,
And each for his life |
the price must lose;
Bring then to Ottar |
the draught of beer,
Of venom full | for an
<END PAGE>
evil fate."

Freyja spake:
51. "Thine evil words |
shall work no ill,
Though, giantess, bitter
<END PAGE>
