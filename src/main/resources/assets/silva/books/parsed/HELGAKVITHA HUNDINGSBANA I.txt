HELGAKVITHA HUNDINGSBANA I
The First Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane
<END PAGE>
1. In olden days, | when
eagles screamed,
And holy streams |
from heaven's crags
fell,
Was Helgi then, | the
<END PAGE>
hero-hearted,
Borghild's son, | in
Bralund born.

2. 'Twas night in the
<END PAGE>
dwelling, | and Norns
there came,
Who shaped the life |
of the lofty one;
They bade him most
famed | of fighters all
And best of princes |
<END PAGE>
ever to be.

3. Mightily wove they |
the web of fate,
While Bralund's towns |
were trembling all;
<END PAGE>
And there the golden |
threads they wove,
And in the moon's hall |
fast they made them.

<END PAGE>
4. East and west | the
ends they hid,
In the middle the hero |
should have his land;
And Neri's kinswoman |
<END PAGE>
northward cast
A chain, and bade it |
firm ever to be.

5. Once sorrow had |
the Ylfings' son,
<END PAGE>
And grief the bride |
who the loved one had
borne.
* * * * * *
Quoth raven to raven, |
<END PAGE>
on treetop resting,
Seeking for food, |
"There is something I
know.

<END PAGE>
6. "In mail-coat stands
| the son of Sigmund,
A half-day old; | now
day is here;
His eyes flash sharp |
<END PAGE>
as the heroes' are,
He is friend of the
wolves; | full glad are
we."

<END PAGE>
7. The warrior throng |
a ruler thought him,
Good times, they said, |
mankind should see;
The king himself | from
<END PAGE>
battle-press came,
To give the prince | a
leek full proud.

8. Helgi he named him, |
<END PAGE>
and Hringstathir gave
him,
Solfjoll, Snæfjoll, | and
Sigarsvoll,
Hringstoth, Hotun, | and
Himinvangar,
And a blood-snake
<END PAGE>
bedecked | to
Sinfjotli's brother.

9. Mighty he grew | in
the midst of his
friends,
The fair-born elm, | in
<END PAGE>
fortune's glow;
To his comrades gold |
he gladly gave,
The hero spared not |
the blood-flecked
hoard.
<END PAGE>
10. Short time for war |
the chieftain waited,
When fifteen winters |
old he was;
Hunding he slew, | the
<END PAGE>
hardy wight
Who long had ruled |
o'er lands and men.

11. Of Sigmund's son |
then next they sought
<END PAGE>
Hoard and rings, | the
sons of Hunding;
They bade the prince |
requital pay
For booty stolen | and
<END PAGE>
father slain.

12. The prince let not |
their prayers avail,
Nor gold for their
<END PAGE>
dead | did the kinsmen
get;
Waiting, he said, | was a
mighty storm
Of lances gray | and
Othin's grimness.

<END PAGE>
13. The warriors forth
| to the battle went,
The field they chose |
at Logafjoll;
Frothi's peace | midst
<END PAGE>
foes they broke,
Through the isle went
hungrily | Vithrir's
hounds.

<END PAGE>
14. The king then sat, |
when he had slain
Eyjolf and Alf, | 'neath
the eagle-stone;
Hjorvarth and
<END PAGE>
Hovarth, | Hunding's
sons,
The kin of the
spear-wielder, | all had
he killed.

<END PAGE>
15. Then glittered light
| from Logafjoll,
And from the light | the
flashes leaped;
. . . . . . . . . .

<END PAGE>
16. . . . . . . . . . .
High under helms | on
heaven's field;
Their byrnies all | with
blood were red,
And from their spears
<END PAGE>
| the sparks flew forth.

17. Early then | in
wolf-wood asked
The mighty king | of the
southern maid,
<END PAGE>
If with the hero | home
would she
Come that night; | the
weapons clashed.

<END PAGE>
18. Down from her
horse | sprang Hogni's
daughter,--

The shields were
<END PAGE>
still,-- | and spake to
the hero:
Other tasks | are ours,
methinks,
Than drinking beer |
with the breaker of
<END PAGE>
rings.

19. My father has
pledged | his daughter
fair
As bride to Granmar's |
<END PAGE>
son so grim;
But, Helgi, I | once
Hothbrodd called
As fine a king | as the
son of a cat.

<END PAGE>
20. "Yet the hero will
come | a few nights
hence,
. . . . . . . . . .
Unless thou dost bid
<END PAGE>
him | the battle-ground
seek,
Or takest the maid |
from the warrior
mighty."

<END PAGE>
Helgi spake:
21. "Fear him not, |
though Isung he felled,
First must our courage
| keen be tried,
Before unwilling | thou
<END PAGE>
fare with the knave;
Weapons will clash, | if
to death I come not."

22. Messengers sent |
the mighty one then,
<END PAGE>
By land and by sea, | a
host to seek,
Store of wealth | of
the water's gleam,
And men to summon, |
<END PAGE>
and sons of men.

23. "Bid them
straightway | seek the
ships,
And off Brandey |
<END PAGE>
ready to be!"
There the chief waited
| till thither were come
Men by hundreds |
from Hethinsey.

<END PAGE>
24. Soon off Stafnsnes
| stood the ships,
Fair they glided | and
gay with gold;

<END PAGE>
Then Helgi spake | to
Hjorleif asking:
Hast thou counted | the
gallant host?

<END PAGE>
25. The young king
answered | the other
then:
Long were it to tell |
from Tronueyr
The long-stemmed
<END PAGE>
ships | with warriors
laden
That come from without
| into Orvasund.

26. . . . . . . . . . .
There are hundreds
<END PAGE>
twelve | of trusty men,
But in Hotun lies | the
host of the king,
Greater by half; | I
have hope of battle."

<END PAGE>
27. The ship's-tents
soon | the chieftain
struck,
And waked the throng |
of warriors all;
(The heroes the red |
<END PAGE>
of dawn beheld;)
And on the masts | the
gallant men
Made fast the sails | in
Varinsfjord.

<END PAGE>
28. There was beat of
oars | and clash of
iron,
Shield smote shield | as
the ships'-folk rowed;
Swiftly went | the
<END PAGE>
warrior-laden
Fleet of the ruler |
forth from the land.

29. So did it sound, |
<END PAGE>
when together the
sisters
Of Kolga struck | with
the keels full long,
As if cliffs were
broken | with beating
<END PAGE>
surf,
. . . . . . . . . .

30. Helgi bade higher |
hoist the sails,
Nor did the ships'-folk
<END PAGE>
| shun the waves,
Though dreadfully | did
Ægir's daughters
Seek the steeds | of
the sea to sink.

<END PAGE>
31. But from above |
did Sigrun brave
Aid the men and | all
their faring;
Mightily came | from the
<END PAGE>
claws of Ron
The leader's
sea-beast | off
Gnipalund.

<END PAGE>
32. At evening there |
in Unavagar
Floated the fleet |
bedecked full fair;
But they who saw |
<END PAGE>
from Svarin's hill,
Bitter at heart | the
host beheld.

33. Then Gothmund
<END PAGE>
asked, | goodly of
birth,
. . . . . . . . . .
Who is the monarch |
who guides the host,
And to the land | the
<END PAGE>
warriors leads?

34. Sinfjotli answered, |
and up on an oar
Raised a shield all red
| with golden rim;
<END PAGE>
A sea-sentry was he, |
skilled to speak,
And in words with
princes | well to strive.

<END PAGE>
35. "Say tonight | when
you feed the swine,
And send your bitches
| to seek their swill,
That out of the East |
<END PAGE>
have the Ylfings come,
Greedy for battle, | to
Gnipalund.

36. "There will
Hothbrodd | Helgi find,
<END PAGE>
In the midst of the
fleet, | and flight he
scorns;
Often has he | the
eagles gorged,
Whilst thou at the
<END PAGE>
quern | wert
slave-girls kissing."

Gothmund spake:
37. "Hero, the ancient |
sayings heed,
And bring not lies | to
<END PAGE>
the nobly born.
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

38. "Thou hast eaten |
the entrails of wolves,
<END PAGE>
And of thy brothers |
the slayer been;
Oft wounds to suck |
thy cold mouth sought,
And loathed in rocky |
<END PAGE>
dens didst lurk."

Sinfjotli spake:
39. "A witch in Varin's |
isle thou wast,
A woman false, | and
<END PAGE>
lies didst fashion;
Of the mail-clad
heroes | thou wouldst
have
No other, thou saidst, |
save Sinfjotli only.
<END PAGE>
40. "A Valkyrie wast
thou, | loathly Witch,
Evil and base, | in
Allfather's home;
The warriors all | must
<END PAGE>
ever fight,
Woman subtle, | for
sake of thee.

41. ". . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
<END PAGE>
Nine did we | in Sogunes
Of wolf-cubs have; | I
their father was."

Gothmund spake:
42. "Thou didst not
<END PAGE>
father |
Fenrir's-wolves,
Though older thou art
| than all I know;
For they gelded thee |
in Gnipalund,
The giant-women | at
<END PAGE>
Thorsnes once.

43. "Under houses the
stepson | of Siggeir
lay,
Fain of the wolf's cry |
<END PAGE>
out in the woods;
Evil came then all | to
thy hands,
When thy brothers' |
breasts thou didst
redden,
<END PAGE>
Fame didst thou win |
for foulest deeds.

44. "In Bravoll wast
thou | Grani's bride,
Golden-bitted | and
<END PAGE>
ready to gallop;
I rode thee many | a
mile, and down
Didst sink, thou
giantess, | under the
saddle."
<END PAGE>
Sinfjotli spake:
45. "A brainless fellow
| didst seem to be,
When once for Gollnir |
goats didst milk,
And another time | when
<END PAGE>
as Imth's daughter
In rags thou wentest; |
wilt longer wrangle?"

Gothmund spake:
46. "Sooner would I | at
<END PAGE>
Frekastein
Feed the ravens | with
flesh of thine
Than send your
bitches | to seek their
swill,
<END PAGE>
Or feed the swine; |
may the fiends take
you!"

Helgi spake:
47. "Better, Sinfjotli, |
<END PAGE>
thee 'twould beseem
Battle to give | and
eagles to gladden,
Than vain and empty |
words to utter,
Though ring-breakers
<END PAGE>
oft | in speech do
wrangle.

48. "Good I find not |
the sons of Granmar,
But for heroes 'tis
<END PAGE>
seemly | the truth to
speak;
At Moinsheimar | proved
the men
That hearts for the
wielding | of swords
<END PAGE>
they had."

49. Mightily then | they
made to run
Sviputh and Sveggjuth
| to Solheimar;
<END PAGE>
(By dewy dales | and
chasms dark,
Mist's horse shook |
where the men went
by;)
The king they found |
<END PAGE>
at his courtyard gate,
And told him the foeman
| fierce was come.

50. Forth stood
<END PAGE>
Hothbrodd, | helmed for
battle,
Watched the riding | of
his warriors;
. . . . . . . . . .
Why are the Hniflungs |
<END PAGE>
white with fear?

Gothmund spake:
51. "Swift keels lie |
hard by the land,
(Mast-ring harts | and
<END PAGE>
mighty yards,
Wealth of shields | and
well-planed oars;)
The king's fair host, |
the Ylfings haughty;
Fifteen bands | to land
<END PAGE>
have fared,
But out in Sogn | are
seven thousand.

52. "At anchor lying |
off Gnipalund
<END PAGE>
Are fire-beasts black,
| all fitted with gold;
There wait most | of
the foeman's men,
Nor will Helgi long | the
<END PAGE>
battle delay."

Hothbrodd spake:
53. "Bid the horses
run | to the Reginthing,
Melnir and Mylnir | to
<END PAGE>
Myrkwood now,
(And Sporvitnir | to
Sparinsheith;)
Let no man seek |
henceforth to sit
Who the flame of
<END PAGE>
wounds | knows well to
wield.

54. "Summon Hogni, | the
sons of Hring,
Atli and Yngvi | and Alf
<END PAGE>
the Old;
Glad they are | of
battle ever;
Against the Volsungs |
let us go."

<END PAGE>
55. Swift as a storm |
there smote together
The flashing blades |
at Frekastein;
Ever was Helgi, |
<END PAGE>
Hunding's slayer,
First in the throng |
where warriors fought;
(Fierce in battle, | slow
to fly,
Hard the heart | of the
<END PAGE>
hero was.)

56. From heaven there
came | the maidens
helmed,--
The weapon-clang
<END PAGE>
grew,-- | who watched
o'er the king;
Spake Sigrun fair,-- |
the wound-givers flew,
And the horse of the
giantess |
<END PAGE>
raven's-food had:--

57. "Hail to thee, hero! |
full happy with men,
Offspring of Yngvi, |
shalt ever live,
<END PAGE>
For thou the fearless |
foe hast slain
Who to many the dread
| of death had brought.

<END PAGE>
58. "Warrior, well | for
thyself hast won
Red rings bright | and
the noble bride;
Both now, warrior, |
<END PAGE>
