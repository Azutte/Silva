SKIRNISMOL
The Ballad of Skirnir
<END PAGE>
1. "Go now, Skirnir! |
and seek to gain
Speech from my son;
And answer to win, |
for whom the wise one
Is mightily moved."

Skirnir spake:
2. "Ill words do I now |
await from thy son,
If I seek to get speech
with him,
<END PAGE>
And answer to win, |
for whom the wise one
Is mightily moved."

Skirnir spake:
3. "Speak prithee,
Freyr, | foremost of
the gods,
For now I fain would
know;
Why sittest thou here |
in the wide halls,
<END PAGE>
Days long, my prince,
alone?"

Freyr spake:
4. "How shall I tell
thee, | thou hero
young,
Of all my grief so
great?
Though every day | the
elfbeam dawns,
<END PAGE>
It lights my longing
never."

Skirnir spake:
5. "Thy longings,
methinks, | are not so
large
That thou mayst not
tell them to me;
Since in days of yore |
we were young
together,
<END PAGE>
We two might each
other trust."

Freyr spake:
6. "From Gymir's house
| I beheld go forth
A maiden dear to me;
Her arms glittered, |
and from their gleam
Shone all the sea and
sky.
<END PAGE>
7. "To me more dear |
than in days of old
Was ever maiden to
man;
But no one of gods |
or elves will grant
That we both together
should be."

<END PAGE>
Skirnir spake:
8. "Then give me the
horse | that goes
through the dark
And magic flickering
flames;
And the sword as well |
that fights of itself
Against the giants
grim."

<END PAGE>
Freyr spake:
9. "The horse will I
give thee | that goes
through the dark
And magic flickering
flames,
And the sword as well |
that will fight of itself
If a worthy hero wields
it."

<END PAGE>
Skirnir spake to the
horse:
10. "Dark is it without, |
and I deem it time
To fare through the
wild fells,
(To fare through the
giants' fastness;)
We shall both come
back, | or us both
together
<END PAGE>
The terrible giant will
take."
Skirnir rode into
Jotunheim to Gymir's
house. There were
fierce dogs bound
before the gate of the
fence
which was around
Gerth's hall. He rode
to where a herdsman
sat on a hill, and said:
<END PAGE>
11. "Tell me, herdsman,
| sitting on the hill,
And watching all the
ways,
How may I win | a word
with the maid
Past the hounds of
Gymir here?"

<END PAGE>
The herdsman spake:
12. "Art thou doomed
to die | or already
dead,
Thou horseman that
ridest hither?
Barred from speech |
shalt thou ever be
With Gymir's daughter
good."

<END PAGE>
Skirnir spake:
13. "Boldness is better
| than plaints can be
For him whose feet
must fare;
To a destined day has
mine age been doomed,
And my life's span
thereto laid."

<END PAGE>
Gerth spake:
14. "What noise is that
which now so loud
I hear within our
house?
The ground shakes,
and the home of Gymir
Around me trembles
too."

<END PAGE>
The Serving-Maid
spake:
15. "One stands without
who has leapt from his
steed,
And lets his horse
loose to graze;"
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

<END PAGE>
Gerth spake:
16. "Bid the man come
in, and drink good mead
Here within our hall;
Though this I fear,
that there without
My brother's slayer
stands.

<END PAGE>
17. "Art thou of the
elves | or the
offspring of gods,
Or of the wise Wanes?
How camst thou alone |
through the leaping
flame
Thus to behold our
home?"

<END PAGE>
Skirnir spake:
18. "I am not of the
elves, | nor the
offspring of gods,
Nor of the wise Wanes;
Though I came alone |
through the leaping
flame
Thus to behold thy
home.

<END PAGE>
19. "Eleven apples, | all
of gold,
Here will I give thee,
Gerth,
To buy thy troth | that
Freyr shall be
Deemed to be dearest
to you."

<END PAGE>
Gerth spake:
20. "I will not take | at
any man's wish
These eleven apples
ever;
Nor shall Freyr and I |
one dwelling find
So long as we two live."

<END PAGE>
Skirnir spake:
21. "Then do I bring
thee | the ring that was
burned
Of old with Othin's son;
From it do eight | of
like weight fall
On every ninth night."

<END PAGE>
Gerth spake:
22. "The ring I wish
not, | though burned it
was
Of old with Othin's son;
In Gymir's home | is no
lack of gold
In the wealth my father
wields."

<END PAGE>
Skirnir spake:
23. "Seest thou, maiden,
| this keen, bright
sword
That I hold here in my
hand?
Thy head from thy
neck | shall I
straightway hew,
If thou wilt not do my
will."
<END PAGE>
Gerth spake:
24. "For no man's sake
| will I ever suffer
To be thus moved by
might;
But gladly, methinks, |
will Gymir seek
To fight if he finds
thee here."

<END PAGE>
Skirnir spake:
25. "Seest thou, maiden,
| this keen, bright
sword
That I hold here in my
hand?
Before its blade the |
old giant bends,--
Thy father is doomed
to die.

<END PAGE>
26. "I strike thee, maid,
| with my magic staff,
To tame thee to work
my will;
There shalt thou go |
where never again
The sons of men shall
see thee.

<END PAGE>
27. "On the eagle's hill
| shalt thou ever sit,
And gaze on the gates
of Hel;
More loathsome to thee
| than the light-hued
snake
To men, shall thy meat
become.

<END PAGE>
28. "Fearful to see, | if
thou comest forth,
Hrimnir will stand and
stare,
(Men will marvel at
thee;)
More famed shalt thou
grow | than the
watchman of the gods!
Peer forth, then, from
thy prison,
<END PAGE>
29. "Rage and longing, |
fetters and wrath,
Tears and torment are
thine;
Where thou sittest
down | my doom is on
thee
Of heavy heart
And double dole.

<END PAGE>
30. "In the giants' home
| shall vile things harm
thee
Each day with evil
deeds;
Grief shalt thou get |
instead of gladness,
And sorrow to suffer
with tears.

<END PAGE>
31. "With three-headed
giants | thou shalt
dwell ever,
Or never know a
husband;
(Let longing grip thee, |
let wasting waste
thee,--)
Be like to the thistle |
that in the loft
Was cast and there
was crushed.
<END PAGE>
32. "I go to the wood, |
and to the wet forest,
To win a magic wand;
. . . . . . . . . .
I won a magic wand.

33. "Othin grows angry,
| angered is the best
of the gods,
Freyr shall be thy foe,
Most evil maid, | who the
magic wrath
<END PAGE>
Of gods hast got for
thyself.

34. "Give heed,
frost-rulers, | hear it,
giants.
Sons of Suttung,
And gods, ye too,
How I forbid | and how
I ban
The meeting of men with
the maid,
<END PAGE>
(The joy of men with
the maid.)

35. "Hrimgrimnir is he, |
the giant who shall
have thee
In the depth by the
doors of Hel;
To the frost-giants'
halls | each day shalt
thou fare,
<END PAGE>
Crawling and craving in
vain,
(Crawling and having
no hope.)

36. "Base wretches
there | by the root of
the tree
Will hold for thee
horns of filth;
A fairer drink | shalt
thou never find,
<END PAGE>
Maid, to meet thy wish,
(Maid, to meet my wish.)

37. "I write thee a
charm | and three
runes therewith,
Longing and madness
and lust;
But what I have writ | I
may yet unwrite
If I find a need
therefor."
<END PAGE>
Gerth spake:
38. "Find welcome
rather, | and with it
take
The frost-cup filled
with mead;
Though I did not
believe | that I should
so love
Ever one of the
Wanes."
<END PAGE>
Skirnir spake:
39. "My tidings all |
must I truly learn
Ere homeward hence I
ride:
How soon thou wilt |
with the mighty son
Of Njorth a meeting
make."

<END PAGE>
Gerth spake:
40. Barri there is, |
which we both know
well,
A forest fair and still;
And nine nights hence |
to the son of Njorth
Will Gerth there grant
delight."
Then Skirnir rode
home. Freyr stood
without, and spoke to
him, and asked for
tidings:
<END PAGE>
41. "Tell me, Skimir, |
ere thou take off the
saddle,
Or farest forward a
step:
What hast thou done |
in the giants' dwelling
To make glad thee or
me?"
Skirnir spoke:

<END PAGE>
42. "Barri there is, |
which we both know
well,
A forest fair and still;
And nine nights hence |
to the son of Njorth
Will Gerth there grant
delight."
