SKIRNISMOL
The Ballad of Skirnir
<END PAGE>
1. "Go now, Skirnir! |
and seek to gain
Speech from my son;
And answer to win, |
for whom the wise one
Is mightily moved."
<END PAGE>
Skirnir spake:
2. "Ill words do I now |
await from thy son,
If I seek to get speech
with him,
And answer to win, |
<END PAGE>
for whom the wise one
Is mightily moved."

Skirnir spake:
3. "Speak prithee,
<END PAGE>
Freyr, | foremost of
the gods,
For now I fain would
know;
Why sittest thou here |
in the wide halls,
Days long, my prince,
<END PAGE>
alone?"

Freyr spake:
4. "How shall I tell
thee, | thou hero
young,
<END PAGE>
Of all my grief so
great?
Though every day | the
elfbeam dawns,
It lights my longing
<END PAGE>
never."

Skirnir spake:
5. "Thy longings,
methinks, | are not so
large
<END PAGE>
That thou mayst not
tell them to me;
Since in days of yore |
we were young
together,
We two might each
<END PAGE>
other trust."

Freyr spake:
6. "From Gymir's house
| I beheld go forth
A maiden dear to me;
<END PAGE>
Her arms glittered, |
and from their gleam
Shone all the sea and
sky.

<END PAGE>
7. "To me more dear |
than in days of old
Was ever maiden to
man;
But no one of gods |
<END PAGE>
or elves will grant
That we both together
should be."

Skirnir spake:
8. "Then give me the
<END PAGE>
horse | that goes
through the dark
And magic flickering
flames;
And the sword as well |
that fights of itself
Against the giants
<END PAGE>
grim."

Freyr spake:
9. "The horse will I
give thee | that goes
through the dark
<END PAGE>
And magic flickering
flames,
And the sword as well |
that will fight of itself
If a worthy hero wields
<END PAGE>
it."

Skirnir spake to the
horse:
10. "Dark is it without, |
and I deem it time
<END PAGE>
To fare through the
wild fells,
(To fare through the
giants' fastness;)
We shall both come
<END PAGE>
back, | or us both
together
The terrible giant will
take."
Skirnir rode into
<END PAGE>
Jotunheim to Gymir's
house. There were
fierce dogs bound
before the gate of the
fence
which was around
Gerth's hall. He rode
<END PAGE>
to where a herdsman
sat on a hill, and said:

11. "Tell me, herdsman,
| sitting on the hill,
And watching all the
<END PAGE>
ways,
How may I win | a word
with the maid
Past the hounds of
Gymir here?"

<END PAGE>
The herdsman spake:
12. "Art thou doomed
to die | or already
dead,
Thou horseman that
<END PAGE>
ridest hither?
Barred from speech |
shalt thou ever be
With Gymir's daughter
good."

<END PAGE>
Skirnir spake:
13. "Boldness is better
| than plaints can be
For him whose feet
must fare;
To a destined day has
<END PAGE>
mine age been doomed,
And my life's span
thereto laid."

Gerth spake:
14. "What noise is that
<END PAGE>
which now so loud
I hear within our
house?
The ground shakes,
and the home of Gymir
Around me trembles
<END PAGE>
too."

The Serving-Maid
spake:
15. "One stands without
<END PAGE>
who has leapt from his
steed,
And lets his horse
loose to graze;"
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

<END PAGE>
Gerth spake:
16. "Bid the man come
in, and drink good mead
Here within our hall;
Though this I fear,
<END PAGE>
that there without
My brother's slayer
stands.

17. "Art thou of the
<END PAGE>
elves | or the
offspring of gods,
Or of the wise Wanes?
How camst thou alone |
through the leaping
flame
Thus to behold our
<END PAGE>
home?"

Skirnir spake:
18. "I am not of the
elves, | nor the
offspring of gods,
<END PAGE>
Nor of the wise Wanes;
Though I came alone |
through the leaping
flame
Thus to behold thy
<END PAGE>
home.

19. "Eleven apples, | all
of gold,
Here will I give thee,
Gerth,
<END PAGE>
To buy thy troth | that
Freyr shall be
Deemed to be dearest
to you."

<END PAGE>
Gerth spake:
20. "I will not take | at
any man's wish
These eleven apples
ever;
Nor shall Freyr and I |
<END PAGE>
one dwelling find
So long as we two live."

Skirnir spake:
21. "Then do I bring
<END PAGE>
thee | the ring that was
burned
Of old with Othin's son;
From it do eight | of
like weight fall
On every ninth night."

<END PAGE>
Gerth spake:
22. "The ring I wish
not, | though burned it
was
Of old with Othin's son;
In Gymir's home | is no
<END PAGE>
lack of gold
In the wealth my father
wields."

Skirnir spake:
23. "Seest thou, maiden,
<END PAGE>
| this keen, bright
sword
That I hold here in my
hand?
Thy head from thy
neck | shall I
<END PAGE>
straightway hew,
If thou wilt not do my
will."

Gerth spake:
24. "For no man's sake
<END PAGE>
| will I ever suffer
To be thus moved by
might;
But gladly, methinks, |
will Gymir seek
To fight if he finds
<END PAGE>
thee here."

Skirnir spake:
25. "Seest thou, maiden,
| this keen, bright
sword
<END PAGE>
That I hold here in my
hand?
Before its blade the |
old giant bends,--
Thy father is doomed
<END PAGE>
to die.

26. "I strike thee, maid,
| with my magic staff,
To tame thee to work
my will;
<END PAGE>
There shalt thou go |
where never again
The sons of men shall
see thee.

<END PAGE>
27. "On the eagle's hill
| shalt thou ever sit,
And gaze on the gates
of Hel;
More loathsome to thee
<END PAGE>
| than the light-hued
snake
To men, shall thy meat
become.

28. "Fearful to see, | if
<END PAGE>
thou comest forth,
Hrimnir will stand and
stare,
(Men will marvel at
thee;)
More famed shalt thou
<END PAGE>
grow | than the
watchman of the gods!
Peer forth, then, from
thy prison,

29. "Rage and longing, |
<END PAGE>
fetters and wrath,
Tears and torment are
thine;
Where thou sittest
down | my doom is on
thee
<END PAGE>
Of heavy heart
And double dole.

30. "In the giants' home
| shall vile things harm
<END PAGE>
thee
Each day with evil
deeds;
Grief shalt thou get |
instead of gladness,
And sorrow to suffer
<END PAGE>
with tears.

31. "With three-headed
giants | thou shalt
dwell ever,
Or never know a
<END PAGE>
husband;
(Let longing grip thee, |
let wasting waste
thee,--)
Be like to the thistle |
that in the loft
<END PAGE>
Was cast and there
was crushed.

32. "I go to the wood, |
and to the wet forest,
To win a magic wand;
<END PAGE>
. . . . . . . . . .
I won a magic wand.

33. "Othin grows angry,
| angered is the best
<END PAGE>
of the gods,
Freyr shall be thy foe,
Most evil maid, | who the
magic wrath
Of gods hast got for
thyself.
<END PAGE>
34. "Give heed,
frost-rulers, | hear it,
giants.
Sons of Suttung,
And gods, ye too,
How I forbid | and how
<END PAGE>
I ban
The meeting of men with
the maid,
(The joy of men with
the maid.)

<END PAGE>
35. "Hrimgrimnir is he, |
the giant who shall
have thee
In the depth by the
doors of Hel;
To the frost-giants'
<END PAGE>
halls | each day shalt
thou fare,
Crawling and craving in
vain,
(Crawling and having
no hope.)

<END PAGE>
36. "Base wretches
there | by the root of
the tree
Will hold for thee
horns of filth;
A fairer drink | shalt
<END PAGE>
thou never find,
Maid, to meet thy wish,
(Maid, to meet my wish.)

37. "I write thee a
<END PAGE>
charm | and three
runes therewith,
Longing and madness
and lust;
But what I have writ | I
may yet unwrite
If I find a need
<END PAGE>
therefor."

Gerth spake:
38. "Find welcome
rather, | and with it
take
<END PAGE>
The frost-cup filled
with mead;
Though I did not
believe | that I should
so love
Ever one of the
<END PAGE>
Wanes."

Skirnir spake:
39. "My tidings all |
must I truly learn
Ere homeward hence I
<END PAGE>
ride:
How soon thou wilt |
with the mighty son
Of Njorth a meeting
make."

<END PAGE>
Gerth spake:
40. Barri there is, |
which we both know
well,
A forest fair and still;
And nine nights hence |
<END PAGE>
to the son of Njorth
Will Gerth there grant
delight."
Then Skirnir rode
<END PAGE>
home. Freyr stood
without, and spoke to
him, and asked for
tidings:

41. "Tell me, Skimir, |
ere thou take off the
<END PAGE>
saddle,
Or farest forward a
step:
What hast thou done |
in the giants' dwelling
To make glad thee or
<END PAGE>
me?"
Skirnir spoke:

42. "Barri there is, |
which we both know
well,
<END PAGE>
A forest fair and still;
And nine nights hence |
to the son of Njorth
Will Gerth there grant
delight."

<END PAGE>
Freyr spake:
43. "Long is one night, |
longer are two;
How then shall I bear
three?
Often to me | has a
<END PAGE>
