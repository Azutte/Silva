ALVISSMOL
The Ballad of Alvis
<END PAGE>
1. "Now shall the bride
| my benches adorn,
And homeward haste
forthwith;
Eager for wedlock | to
<END PAGE>
all shall I seem,
Nor at home shall they
rob me of rest."

Thor spake:
2. "What, pray, art
<END PAGE>
thou? | Why so pale
round the nose?
By the dead hast thou
lain of late?
To a giant like | dost
thou look, methinks;
Thou wast not born
<END PAGE>
for the bride."

Alvis spake:
3. "Alvis am I, | and
under the earth
My home 'neath the
<END PAGE>
rocks I have;
With the wagon-guider |
a word do I seek,
Let the gods their
bond not break."

<END PAGE>
Thor spake:
4. "Break it shall I, |
for over the bride
Her father has
foremost right;
At home was I not |
<END PAGE>
when the promise thou
hadst,
And I give her alone of
the gods."

Alvis spake:
5. "What hero claims |
<END PAGE>
such right to hold
O'er the bride that
shines so bright?
Not many will know thee,
| thou wandering man!
Who was bought with
<END PAGE>
rings to bear thee?"

Thor spake:
6. "Vingthor, the
wanderer | wide, am I,
And I am Sithgrani's
<END PAGE>
son;
Against my will | shalt
thou get the maid,
And win the marriage
word."

<END PAGE>
Alvis spake:
7. "Thy good-will now |
shall I quickly get,
And win the marriage
word;
I long to have, | and I
<END PAGE>
would not lack,
This snow-white maid
for mine."

Thor spake:
8. "The love of the
<END PAGE>
maid | I may not keep
thee
From winning, thou
guest so wise,
If of every world |
thou canst tell me all
That now I wish to
<END PAGE>
know.

9. "Answer me, Alvis! |
thou knowest all,
Dwarf, of the doom of
men:
<END PAGE>
What call they the
earth, | that lies
before all,
In each and every
world?"

<END PAGE>
Alvis spake:
10. " 'Earth' to men,
'Field' | to the gods it
is,
The Ways' is it called
<END PAGE>
by the Wanes;
Ever Green' by the
giants, | 'The Grower'
by elves,
The Moist' by the holy
ones high."
<END PAGE>
Thor spake:
11. "Answer me, Alvis! |
thou knowest all,
Dwarf, of the doom of
men:
What call they the
<END PAGE>
heaven, | beheld of the
high one,
In each and every
world?"

Dripping Hall.'"

men.:
What call they the
moon, | that men behold,
In each and every
world?"

<END PAGE>
Alvis spake:
14. "'Moon' with men,
'Flame' | the gods
among,

<END PAGE>
of hell;

of Time."
<END PAGE>

world?"

The Deceiver of Dvalin'
the dwarfs;
The giants 'The
Ever-Bright,' | elves

<END PAGE>

men:

rains,
<END PAGE>
In each and every
world?"

Alvis spake:
18. "'Clouds' men name
<END PAGE>
them, | 'Rain-Hope' gods
call them,
The Wanes call them
'Kites of the Wind';
Water-Hope' giants, |
'Weather-Might' elves,
The Helmet of Secrets'
<END PAGE>
in hell."

Thor spake:
19. "Answer me, Alvis! |

In each and every
world?"

<END PAGE>

it, | the gods 'The
Waverer,'
The Neigher' the holy
<END PAGE>
ones high;
The Wailer' the giants, |
'Roaring Wender' the
elves,
In hell 'The Blustering
Blast.'
<END PAGE>
Thor spake:
21. "Answer me, Alvis! |

What call they the calm,
<END PAGE>
| that quiet lies,
In each and every
world?"

In each and every
world?"

<END PAGE>

gods 'The
Smooth-Lying,'
The Wave' is it called
<END PAGE>
by the Wanes;
Eel-Home' the giants, |
'Drink-Stuff' the elves,
For the dwarfs its
name is 'The Deep.'

<END PAGE>

<END PAGE>
| that flames for men,
In each of all the
worlds?"

26. " 'Fire' men call it, |
<END PAGE>
and 'Flame' the gods,
By the Wanes is it
'Wildfire' called;
The Biter' by giants, |
'The Burner' by
dwarfs,
<END PAGE>
The Swift' in the house
of hell."

mankind,
<END PAGE>
In each and every
world?"

<END PAGE>
Wood, | gods 'The Mane
of the Field,'
Seaweed of Hills' in
hell;

| 'Fair-Limbed' the
<END PAGE>
elves,
The Wand' is it called
by the Wanes."

Nor,
<END PAGE>
In each and every
world?"

In each and every
world?"

'Beer' the gods among,
In the world of the
Wanes 'The Foaming';
Bright Draught' with
<END PAGE>
giants, | 'Mead' with
dwellers in hell,
The Feast-Draught'
with Suttung's sons."

Thor spake:
.3.5. "In a single breast
<END PAGE>
| I never have seen
More wealth of wisdom
old;
But with treacherous
wiles | must I now
betray thee:
