HELGAKVITHA HJORVARTHSSONAR
The Lay of Helgi the Son of Hjorvarth
<END PAGE>
1. "Sawest thou Sigrlin,
| Svafnir's daughter,
The fairest maid | in
her home-land found?
Though Hjorvath's
<END PAGE>
wives | by men are held
Goodly to see | in
Glasir's wood."

Atli spake:
2. "Now with Atli, |
<END PAGE>
Ithmund's son,
Wilt thou say more, |
thou bird so wise?"

The bird spake:
I may if the prince | an
<END PAGE>
offering makes,
And I have what I will |
from the house of the
king.

<END PAGE>
Atli spake:
3. "Choose not
Hjorvarth, | nor sons
of his,
Nor the wives so fair |
<END PAGE>
of the famous chief;
Ask not the brides |
that the prince's are;
Fair let us deal | in
friendly wise."

<END PAGE>
The bird spake:
4. "A fane will I ask, |
and altars many,
Gold-horned cattle |
the prince shall give
<END PAGE>
me,
If Sigrlin yet | shall
sleep in his arms,
Or free of will | the
hero shall follow."
This was before Atli
<END PAGE>
went on his journey;
but when he came home,
and the king asked his
tidings, he
said:

5. "Trouble we had, |
<END PAGE>
but tidings none,
Our horses failed | in
the mountains high,
The waters of SÃ¦morn |
we needs must wade;
Svafnir's daughter, |
<END PAGE>
with rings bedecked,
She whom we sought, |
was still denied us."
The king bade that
<END PAGE>
they should go
another time, and he
went with them himself,
But when they came up
on the mountain, they
saw Svavaland burning
<END PAGE>
and mighty dust-clouds
from many steeds. The
king rode
from the mountain
forward into the land,
and made a night's
<END PAGE>
stay hard by a stream.
Atli kept watch and
went over the stream;
he found there a
house. A great bird sat
on the housetop to
<END PAGE>
guard it, but he was
asleep. Atli hurled his
spear at the bird and
slew it, and in the
house he found Sigrlin
the king's daughter
<END PAGE>
and Alof the jarl's
daughter, and he
brought them both
thence with him. Jarl
Franmar had changed
himself into the
<END PAGE>
likeness of an eagle,
and guarded them from
the enemy host by
magic. Hrothmar was
the
name of a king, a wooer
of Sigrlin; he slew the
king of Svavaland and
<END PAGE>
had plundered and
burned his land. King
Hjorvarth took Sigrlin,
and Atli took
Alof.
(II)
Hjorvarth and Sigrlin
<END PAGE>
had a son, mighty and
of noble stature; he
was a silent man, and
no name stuck fast

to him. He sat on a hill,
<END PAGE>
and saw nine Valkyries
riding; one of them was
the fairest of all. She
spake:
6. "Late wilt thou, Helgi,
| have hoard of rings,
Thou battle-tree
<END PAGE>
fierce, | or of shining
fields,--
The eagle screams
soon,-- | if never thou
speakest,
Though, hero, hard |
<END PAGE>
thy heart may cry."

Helgi spake:
7. "What gift shall I
have | with Helgi's name,
Glorious maid, | for the
<END PAGE>
giving is thine?
All thy words | shall I
think on well,
But I want them not | if
I win not thee."

<END PAGE>
The Valkyrie spake:
8. "Swords I know lying
| in Sigarsholm,
Fifty there are | save
only four;
One there is | that is
<END PAGE>
best of all,
The shield-destroyer, |
with gold it shines.

9. "In the hilt is fame, |
in the haft is courage,
<END PAGE>
In the point is fear, |
for its owner's foes;
On the blade there lies
| a blood-flecked
snake,
And a serpent's tail |
<END PAGE>
round the flat is
twisted."
Eylimi was the name of
a king, whose daughter
was Svava; she was a
Valkyrie, and rode air
<END PAGE>
and sea. She

gave Helgi this name,
and shielded him oft
thereafter in battle.
Helgi spake:
<END PAGE>
10. "Hjorvarth, king, |
unwholesome thy
counsels,
Though famed thou art
| in leading the folk,
Letting fire the homes
<END PAGE>
of heroes eat,
Who evil deed had
never done thee.

11. "Yet Hrothmar still
the hoard doth hold,
<END PAGE>
The wealth that once
our kinsmen wielded;
Full seldom care the
king disturbs,
Heir to dead men he
<END PAGE>
deems himself."
Hjorvarth answered
that he would give Helgi
a following if he fain
would avenge his
mother's father.
<END PAGE>
Then Helgi got the
sword that Svava had
told him of. So he went,
and Atli with him, and
they slew
Hrothmar, and they did
<END PAGE>
many great deeds.
(III)
He slew the giant Hati,
whom he found sitting
on a certain mountain.
<END PAGE>
Helgi and Atli lay with
their ships

in Hatafjord. Atli kept
watch during the first
<END PAGE>
part of the night.
Hrimgerth, Hati's
daughter, spake:
12. "Who are the
heroes | in Hatafjord?
The ships are covered
with shields;
<END PAGE>
Bravely ye look, | and
little ye fear,
The name of the king
would I know."

<END PAGE>
Atli spake:
13. "Helgi his name, |
and never thou mayst
Harm to the hero bring;
With iron is fitted | the
<END PAGE>
prince's fleet,
Nor can witches work
us ill."

Hrimgerth spake:
14. "Who now, thou
<END PAGE>
mighty | man, art thou?
By what name art thou
known to men?
He trusts thee well, |
the prince who wills
That thou stand at the
<END PAGE>
stem of his ship."

Atli spake:
15. "Atli am I, | and ill
shalt thou find me,
Great hate for witches
<END PAGE>
I have;
Oft have I been | in the
dripping bows,
And to dusk-riders
death have brought.

<END PAGE>
16. "Corpse-hungry
giantess, | how art thou
called?
Say, witch, who thy
father was!
Nine miles deeper |
<END PAGE>
down mayst thou sink,
And a tree grow tall on
thy bosom."

Hrimgerth spake:
17. "Hrimgerth am I, |
<END PAGE>
my father was Hati,
Of giants the most in
might;
Many a woman | he won
from her home,
Ere Helgi hewed him
<END PAGE>
down."

Atli spake:
18. "Witch, in front | of
the ship thou wast,
And lay before the
<END PAGE>
fjord;
To Ron wouldst have
given | the ruler's men,
If a spear had not
stuck in thy flesh."

<END PAGE>
Hrimgerth spake:
19. "Dull art thou, Atli, |
thou dreamest,
methinks,
The lids lie over thine
<END PAGE>
eyes;
By the leader's ships |
my mother lay,
Hlothvarth's sons on
the sea I slew.

<END PAGE>
20. "Thou wouldst
neigh, Atli, | but gelded
thou art,
See, Hrimgerth hoists
her tail;
In thy hinder end | is
<END PAGE>
thy heart, methinks,
Though thy speech is a
stallion's cry."

Atli spake:
21. "A stallion I seem |
<END PAGE>
if thou seekest to try
me,
And I leap to land from
the sea;
I shall smite thee to
bits, | if so I will,
And heavy sinks
<END PAGE>
Hrimgerth's tail."

Hrimgerth spake:
22. "Go ashore then,
Atli, | if sure of thy
might,
<END PAGE>
Let us come to Varin's
cove;
Straight shall thy
rounded | ribs be made
If thou comest within
<END PAGE>
my claws."

Atli spake:
23. "I will not go | till
the warriors wake,
Again their chief to
<END PAGE>
guard;
I should wonder not, |
foul witch, if up
From beneath our keel
thou shouldst come."

<END PAGE>
Hrimgerth spake:
24. "Awake now, Helgi, |
and Hrimgerth requite,
That Hati to death thou
didst hew;
If a single night | she
<END PAGE>
can sleep by the
prince,
Then requited are all
her ills."

Helgi spake:
25. " 'Tis Lothin shall
<END PAGE>
have thee,-- | thou'rt
loathsome to men,--
His home in Tholley he
has;
Of the wild-dwellers
worst | is the giant
<END PAGE>
wise,
He is meet as a mate
for thee."

Hrimgerth spake:
26. "More thou lovest
<END PAGE>
her | who scanned the
harbor,
Last night among the
men;
(The gold-decked maid
| bore magic, rnethinks,
When the land from the
<END PAGE>
sea she sought,
And fast she kept your
fleet;)
She alone is to blame |
that I may not bring
Death to the monarch's
<END PAGE>
men."

Helgi spake:
27. "Hrimgerth, mark, |
if thy hurts I requite,
Tell now the truth to
<END PAGE>
the king;
Was there one who the
ships | of the warrior
warded,
Or did many together
go?"
<END PAGE>
Hrimgerth spake:
28. "Thrice nine there
were, | but one rode
first,
A helmed maid white of
<END PAGE>
hue;
Their horses quivered,
| there came from their
manes
Dew in the dales so
deep,
<END PAGE>
(Hail on the woods so
high,
Thence men their
harvest have,
But ill was the sight I
<END PAGE>
saw.)"

Atli spake:
29. "Look eastward,
Hrimgerth, | for Helgi
has struck thee
<END PAGE>
Down with the runes of
death;
Safe in harbor floats |
the prince's fleet,
And safe are the
<END PAGE>
monarch's men."

Helgi spake:
30. "It is day,
Hrimgerth, | for Atli
held thee
<END PAGE>
Till now thy life thou
must lose;
As a harbor mark | men
shall mock at thee,
Where in stone thou
<END PAGE>
shalt ever stand."
(IV)
King Helgi was a mighty
warrior. He came to
King Eylimi and sought
<END PAGE>
the hand of his
daughter, Svava.
Then Helgi and Svava
exchanged vows, and
greatly they loved
each other. Svava was
<END PAGE>
at home with her
father, while Helgi was
in the field; Svava was
still a Valkyrie as
before.
Hethin was at home with
<END PAGE>
his father, King
Hjorvarth, in Norway.
Hethin was coming home
alone from the
forest one Yule-eve,
and found a
troll-woman; she rode
on a wolf, and had
<END PAGE>
snakes in place of a
bridle. She asked
Hethin for his company.
"Nay," said he. She
said, "Thou shalt pay
for this at the king's
<END PAGE>
toast." That evening
the great vows were
taken; the sacred boar
was brought in, the men
laid their hands
thereon, and took their
<END PAGE>
vows at the king's
toast. Hethin vowed
that he would have
Svava, Eylimi's
daughter, the beloved
of his brother Helgi;
<END PAGE>
then such great grief
seized him that he went
forth on wild paths
southward over the
land, and found Helgi,
his brother. Helgi
<END PAGE>
said:
3 1. "Welcome, Hethin! |
what hast thou to tell
Of tidings new | that
from Norway come?
Wherefore didst leave |
<END PAGE>
thy land, O prince,
And fared alone | to
find us here?"

Hethin spake:
32. "A deed more evil |
<END PAGE>
I have done
Than, brother mine, |
thou e'er canst mend;
For I have chosen |
the child of the king,
Thy bride, for mine | at
<END PAGE>
the monarch's toast."

Helgi spake:
33. "Grieve not, Hethin,
| for true shall hold
The words we both | by
<END PAGE>
the beer have sworn;
To the isle a warrior |
wills that I go,
(There shall I come |
the third night hence;)
And doubtful must be |
<END PAGE>
my coming back,
(So may all be well, | if
fate so wills.)"

Hethin spake:
34. "Thou saidst once,
<END PAGE>
Helgi, | that Hethin was
A friend full good, |
and gifts didst give him;
More seemly it were |
thy sword to redden,
Than friendship thus |
<END PAGE>
to thy foe to-give."
Helgi spoke thus
because he foresaw
his death, for his
following-spirits had
<END PAGE>
met Hethin when he saw
the
woman riding on the
wolf. Alf was the name
of a king, the son of
Hrothmar, who had
<END PAGE>
marked out a
battle-place with

Helgi at Sigarsvoll
after a stay of three
<END PAGE>
nights. Then Helgi
spake:
35. "On a wolf there
rode, | when dusk it
was,
A woman who fain |
<END PAGE>
would have him follow;
Well she knew | that
now would fall
Sigrlin's son | at
Sigarsvoll."
There was a great
<END PAGE>
battle, and there Helgi
got a mortal wound.

36. Sigar riding | did
Helgi send
To seek out Eylimi's |
<END PAGE>
only daughter:
Bid her swiftly | ready
to be,
If her lover | alive she
would find.

<END PAGE>
Sigar spake:
37. "Hither now | has
Helgi sent me,
With thee, Svava, |
thyself to speak;
The hero said | he fain
<END PAGE>
would see thee
Ere life the nobly |
born should leave."

Svava spake:
A "What chanced with
<END PAGE>
Helgi, | Hjorvarth's
son?
Hard to me | is harm
now come;
If the sea smote him, |
or sword bit him,
Ill shall I bring | to all
<END PAGE>
his foes."

Sigar spake:
39. "In the morn he fell
| at Frekastein,
The king who was
<END PAGE>
noblest | beneath the
sun;
Alf has the joy | of
victory all,
Though need therefor
| is never his."

<END PAGE>
Helgi spake:
40. "Hail to thee, Svava!
| thy sorrow rule,
Our meeting last | in
life is this;
Hard the wounds | of
<END PAGE>
the hero bleed,
And close to my heart |
the sword has come.

41. "I bid thee,
<END PAGE>
Svava,-- | weep not,
bride,--
If thou wilt hearken |
to these my words,
The bed for Hethin |
have thou ready,
And yield thy love | to
<END PAGE>
the hero young."

Svava spake:
42. "A vow I had | in my
dear-loved home,
When Helgi sought | with
<END PAGE>
rings to have me,
That not of my will, | if
the warrior died,
Would I fold in my arms
| a man unfamed."

<END PAGE>
Hethin spake:
43. "Kiss me, Svava, | I
come not back,
Rogheim to see, | or
Rothulsfjoll,
Till vengeance I have |
<END PAGE>
for the son of
Hjorvarth,
The king who was
noblest | beneath the
sun."
Of Helgi and Svava it is
<END PAGE>
