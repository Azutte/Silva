GUTHRUNARKVITHA II, EN FORNA
The Second, or Old, Lay of Guthrun
<END PAGE>
1. A maid of maids | my
mother bore me,
Bright in my bower, | my
brothers I loved,
Till Gjuki dowered | me
<END PAGE>
with gold,
Dowered with gold, |
and to Sigurth gave me.

2. So Sigurth rose |
o'er Gjuki's sons
<END PAGE>
As the leek grows
green | above the
grass,
Or the stag o'er all |
the beasts doth stand,
Or as glow-red gold |
<END PAGE>
above silver gray.

3. Till my brothers let
me | no longer have
The best of heroes |
my husband to be;
<END PAGE>
Sleep they could not, |
or quarrels settle,
Till Sigurth they | at
last had slain.

<END PAGE>
4. From the Thing ran
Grani | with thundering
feet,
But thence did Sigurth |
himself come never;
Covered with sweat |
<END PAGE>
was the
saddle-bearer,
Wont the warrior's |
weight to bear.

5. Weeping I sought |
<END PAGE>
with Grani to speak,
With tear-wet cheeks |
for the tale I asked;
The head of Grani |
was bowed to the
grass,
<END PAGE>
The steed knew well |
his master was slain.

6. Long I waited | and
pondered well
Ere ever the king | for
<END PAGE>
tidings I asked.
. . . . . . . . . .

7. His head bowed
Gunnar, | but Hogni told
The news full sore | of
<END PAGE>
Sigurth slain:
Hewed to death | at our
hands he lies,
Gotthorm's slayer, |
given to wolves.

<END PAGE>
8. On the southern
road | thou shalt
Sigurth see,
Where hear thou canst
| the ravens cry;
The eagles cry | as
<END PAGE>
food they crave,
And about thy husband
| wolves are howling."

9. "Why dost thou,
Hogni, | such a horror
<END PAGE>
Let me hear, | all
joyless left?
Ravens yet | thy heart
shall rend
In a land that never |
<END PAGE>
thou hast known."

10. Few the words | of
Hogni were,
Bitter his heart | from
heavy sorrow:
<END PAGE>
Greater, Guthrun, | thy
grief shall be
If the ravens so | my
heart shall rend.

<END PAGE>
11. From him who spake
| I turned me soon,
In the woods to find |
what the wolves had
left;
Tears I had not, | nor
<END PAGE>
wrung my bands,
Nor wailing went, | as
other women,
(When by Sigurth | slain
I sat).

<END PAGE>
12. Never so black |
had seemed the night
As when in sorrow | by
Sigurth I sat;
The wolves . . . . . . . . . .

<END PAGE>
13. . . . . . . . . . .
Best of all | methought
'twould be
If I my life | could only
lose,
Or like to birch-wood |
<END PAGE>
burned might be.

14. From the mountain
forth | five days I
fared,
Till Hoalf's hall | so
<END PAGE>
high I saw;
Seven half-years | with
Thora I stayed,
Hokon's daughter, | in
Denmark then.

<END PAGE>
15. With gold she
broidered, | to bring me
joy,
Southern halls | and
Danish swans;
On the tapestry wove
<END PAGE>
we | warrior's deeds,
And the hero's thanes
| on our handiwork;
(Flashing shields | and
fighters armed,
Sword-throng,
<END PAGE>
helm-throng, | the host
of the king).

16. Sigmund's ship | by
the land was sailing,
Golden the
<END PAGE>
figure-head, | gay the
beaks;
On board we wove | the
warriors faring,
Sigar and Siggeir, |
south to Fjon.

<END PAGE>
17. Then Grimhild asked,
| the Gothic queen,
Whether willingly would
I . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

<END PAGE>
18. Her needlework
cast she | aside, and
called
Her sons to ask, | with
stern resolve,
Who amends to their
<END PAGE>
sister | would make for
her son,
Or the wife requite |
for her husband killed.

19. Ready was Gunnar |
<END PAGE>
gold to give,
Amends for my hurt, |
and Hogni too;
Then would she know |
who now would go,
The horse to saddle, |
<END PAGE>
the wagon to harness,
(The horse to ride, |
the hawk to fly,
And shafts from bows |
of yew to shoot).

<END PAGE>
20. (Valdar, king | of
the Danes, was come,
With Jarizleif, Eymoth, |
and Jarizskar).
In like princes | came
<END PAGE>
they all,
The long-beard men, |
with mantles red,
Short their mail-coats,
| mighty their helms,
Swords at their belts, |
<END PAGE>
and brown their hair.

21. Each to give me |
gifts was fain,
Gifts to give, | and
goodly speech,
<END PAGE>
Comfort so | for my
sorrows great
To bring they tried, |
but I trusted them not.

<END PAGE>
22. A draught did
Grimhild | give me to
drink,
Bitter and cold; | I
forgot my cares;
For mingled therein
<END PAGE>
was magic earth,
Ice-cold sea, and the
blood of swine.

23. In the cup were
runes of every kind,
<END PAGE>
Written and reddened, I
could not read them;
A heather-fish from
the Haddings' land,
An ear uncut, and the
<END PAGE>
entrails of beasts.

24. Much evil was
brewed within the beer,
Blossoms of trees, and
acorns burned,
<END PAGE>
Dew of the hearth, and
holy entrails,
The liver of swine,--
all grief to allay.

<END PAGE>
25. Then I forgot, when
the draught they gave
me,
There in the hall, my
husband's slaying;
On their knees the
<END PAGE>
kings all three did
kneel,
Ere she herself to
speak began:

26. "Guthrun, gold | to
<END PAGE>
thee I give,
The wealth that once |
thy father's was,
Rings to have, | and
Hlothver's halls,
And the hangings all |
<END PAGE>
that the monarch had.

27. "Hunnish women, |
skilled in weaving,
Who gold make fair | to
give thee joy,
<END PAGE>
And the wealth of
Buthli | thine shall be,
Gold-decked one, | as
Atli's wife."

<END PAGE>
Guthrun spake:
28. "A husband now | I
will not have,
Nor wife of Brynhild's |
brother be;
It beseems me not | with
<END PAGE>
Buthli's son
Happy to be, | and
heirs to bear."

Grimhild spake:
29. "Seek not on men |
<END PAGE>
to avenge thy sorrows,
Though the blame at
first | with us hath
been;
Happy shalt be | as if
both still lived,
<END PAGE>
Sigurth and Sigmund, |
if sons thou bearest."

Guthrun spake:
30. "Grimhild, I may not |
<END PAGE>
gladness find,
Nor hold forth hopes |
to heroes now,
Since once the raven |
and ravening wolf
Sigurth's
<END PAGE>
heart's-blood |
hungrily lapped."

Grimhild spake:
31. "Noblest of birth |
is the ruler now
I have found for thee,
<END PAGE>
| and foremost of all;
Him shalt thou have |
while life thou hast,
Or husbandless be | if
him thou wilt choose
not."
<END PAGE>
Guthrun spake:
32. "Seek not so
eagerly | me to send
To be a bride | of yon
baneful race;
On Gunnar first | his
<END PAGE>
wrath shall fall,
And the heart will he
tear | from Hogni's
breast."

<END PAGE>
33. Weeping Grimhild |
heard the words
That fate full sore |
for her sons foretold,
(And mighty woe | for
<END PAGE>
them should work;)
Lands I give thee, | with
all that live there,
(Vinbjorg is thine, |
and Valbjorg too,)
Have them forever, |
<END PAGE>
but hear me, daughter.

34. So must I do | as
the kings besought,
And against my will |
for my kinsmen wed,
<END PAGE>
Ne'er with my husband |
joy I had,
And my sons by my
brothers' | fate were
saved not.

<END PAGE>
35. . . . . . . . . . .
I could not rest | till of
life I had robbed
The warrior bold, | the
maker of battles.

<END PAGE>
36. Soon on horseback
| each hero was,
And the foreign women
| in wagons faring;
A week through lands |
<END PAGE>
so cold we went,
And a second week |
the waves we smote,
(And a third through
lands | that water
lacked).
<END PAGE>
37. The warders now |
on the lofty walls
Opened the gates, | and
in we rode.
* * * * * *

<END PAGE>
38. Atli woke me, | for
ever I seemed
Of bitterness full | for
my brothers' death.

<END PAGE>
Atli spake:
39. "Now from sleep |
the Norris have waked
me
With visions of
<END PAGE>
terror,-- | to thee will
I tell them;
Methought thou,
Guthrun, | Gjuki's
daughter,
With poisoned blade |
<END PAGE>
didst pierce my body."

Guthrun spake:
40. "Fire a dream | of
steel shall follow
And willful pride | one
<END PAGE>
of woman's wrath;
A baneful sore | I shall
burn from thee,
And tend and heal
thee, | though hated
thou am"
<END PAGE>
Atli spake:
41. "Of plants I
dreamed, | in the
garden drooping,
That fain would I have |
<END PAGE>
full high to grow;
Plucked by the roots, |
and red with blood,
They brought them
hither, | and bade me
eat.
<END PAGE>
42. "I dreamed my
hawks | from my hand
had flown,
Eager for food, | to an
evil house;
I dreamed their hearts
<END PAGE>
| with honey I ate,
Soaked in blood, | and
heavy my sorrow.

43. "Hounds I dreamed
<END PAGE>
| from my hand I
loosed,
Loud in hunger | and
pain they howled;
Their flesh methought |
was eagles' food,
And their bodies now | I
<END PAGE>
needs must eat."

Guthrun spake:
44. "Men shall soon | of
sacrifice speak,
And off the heads | of
<END PAGE>
beasts shall hew
Die they shall | ere day
has dawned,
A few nights hence, |
and the folk shall have
them."
<END PAGE>
Atli spake:
45. "On my bed I sank, |
nor slumber sought,
Weary with woe,-- | full
well I remember.
. . . . . . . . . .
