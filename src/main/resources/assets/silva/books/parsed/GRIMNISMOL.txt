GRIMNISMOL
The Ballad of Grimnir
<END PAGE>
1. Hot art thou, fire! |
too fierce by far;
Get ye now gone, ye
flames!
The mantle is burnt, |
though I bear it aloft,
And the fire scorches
the fur.

<END PAGE>
2. 'Twixt the fires now |
eight nights have I sat,
And no man brought
meat to me,
Save Agnar alone, |
and alone shall rule
Geirröth's son o'er
the Goths.

<END PAGE>
3. Hail to thee, Agnar! |
for hailed thou art
By the voice of
Veratyr;
For a single drink |
shalt thou never
receive
A greater gift as
reward.

<END PAGE>
4. The land is holy |
that lies hard by
The gods and the
elves together;
And Thor shall ever |
in Thruthheim dwell,
Till the gods to
destruction go.

<END PAGE>
5. Ydalir call they | the
place where Ull
A hall for himself hath
set;
And Alfheim the gods |
to Freyr once gave
As a tooth-gift in
ancient times.

<END PAGE>
6. A third home is
there, | with silver
thatched
By the hands of the
gracious gods:
Valaskjolf is it, | in
days of old
Set by a god for
himself.

<END PAGE>
7. Sökkvabekk is the
fourth, | where cool
waves flow,
And amid their murmur
it stands;
There daily do Othin |
and Saga drink
In gladness from cups
of gold.

<END PAGE>
8. The fifth is
Glathsheim, | and
gold-bright there
Stands Valhall
stretching wide;
And there does Othin |
each day choose
The men who have
fallen in fight.

<END PAGE>
9. Easy is it to know |
for him who to Othin
Comes and beholds the
hall;
Its rafters are
spears, | with shields is
it roofed,
On its benches are
breastplates strewn.

<END PAGE>
10. Easy is it to know |
for him who to Othin
Comes and beholds the
hall;
There hangs a wolf |
by the western door,
And o'er it an eagle
hovers.

<END PAGE>
11. The sixth is
Thrymheim, | where
Thjazi dwelt,
The giant of marvelous
might;
Now Skathi abides, | the
god's fair bride,
In the home that her
father had.

<END PAGE>
12. The seventh is
Breithablik; | Baldr has
there
For himself a dwelling
set,
In the land I know |
that lies so fair,
And from evil fate is
free.

<END PAGE>
13. Himinbjorg is the
eighth, | and Heimdall
there
O'er men holds sway, it
is said;
In his well-built house |
does the warder of
heaven
The good mead gladly
drink.

<END PAGE>
14. The ninth is
Folkvang, | where
Freyja decrees
Who shall have seats in
the hall;
The half of the dead |
each day does she
choose,
And half does Othin
have.

<END PAGE>
15. The tenth is Glitnir;
| its pillars are gold,
And its roof with silver
is set;
There most of his days
| does Forseti dwell,
And sets all strife at
end.

<END PAGE>
16. The eleventh is
Noatun; | there has
Njorth
For himself a dwelling
set;
The sinless ruler | of
men there sits
In his temple timbered
high.

<END PAGE>
17. Filled with growing
trees | and
high-standing grass
Is Vithi, Vithar's land;
But there did the son |
from his steed leap
down,
When his father he fain
would avenge.

<END PAGE>
18. In Eldhrimnir |
Andhrimnir cooks
Sæhrimnir's seething
flesh,--
The best of food, | but
few men know
On what fare the
warriors feast.

<END PAGE>
19. Freki and Geri |
does Heerfather feed,
The far-famed fighter
of old:
But on wine alone |
does the
weapon-decked god,
Othin, forever live.

<END PAGE>
20. O'er Mithgarth
Hugin | and Munin both
Each day set forth to
fly;
For Hugin I fear | lest
he come not home,
But for Munin my care
is more.

<END PAGE>
21. Loud roars Thund, |
and Thjothvitnir's fish
joyously fares in the
flood;
Hard does it seem | to
the host of the slain
To wade the torrent
wild.

<END PAGE>
22. There Valgrind
stands, | the sacred
gate,
And behind are the
holy doors;
Old is the gate, | but
few there are
Who can tell how it
tightly is locked.

<END PAGE>
23. Five hundred doors
| and forty there are,
I ween, in Valhall's
walls;
Eight hundred fighters
| through one door
fare
When to war with the
wolf they go.

<END PAGE>
24. Five hundred rooms
| and forty there are
I ween, in Bilskirnir
built;
Of all the homes |
whose roofs I beheld,
My son's the greatest
meseemed.

<END PAGE>
25. Heithrun is the goat
| who stands by
Heerfather's hall,
And the branches of
Lærath she bites;
The pitcher she fills |
with the fair, clear
mead,
Ne'er fails the foaming
drink.

<END PAGE>
26. Eikthyrnir is the
hart | who stands by
Heerfather's hall
And the branches of
Lærath he bites;
From his horns a
stream | into
Hvergelmir drops,
Thence all the rivers
run.

<END PAGE>
27. Sith and Vith, | Sækin
and Ækin,
Svol and Fimbulthul, |
Gunnthro, and Fjorm,
Rin and Rinnandi,
Gipul and Gopul, | Gomul
and Geirvimul,
That flow through the
fields of the gods;
Thyn and Vin, | Thol
and Hol,
<END PAGE>
Groth and Gunnthorin.

28. Vino is one, |
Vegsvin another,
And Thjothnuma a
third;
Nyt and Not, | Non and
Hron,
Slith and Hrith, | Sylg
and Ylg,
Vith and Von, | Vond
and Strond,
<END PAGE>
Gjol and Leipt, | that
go among men,
And hence they fall to
Hel.

29. Kormt and Ormt |
and the Kerlaugs twain
Shall Thor each day
wade through,
(When dooms to give |
he forth shall go
<END PAGE>
To the ash-tree
Yggdrasil;)
For heaven's bridge |
burns all in flame,
And the sacred waters
seethe.

30. Glath and Gyllir, |
Gler and Skeithbrimir,
Silfrintopp and Sinir,
Gisl and Falhofnir, |
Golltopp and Lettfeti,
<END PAGE>
On these steeds the
gods shall go
When dooms to give |
each day they ride
To the ash-tree
Yggdrasil.

31. Three roots there
are | that three ways
run
Neath the ash-tree
Yggdrasil;
<END PAGE>
Neath the first lives
Hel, | 'neath the second
the frost-giants,
Neath the last are the
lands of men.

32. Ratatosk is the
squirrel | who there
shall run
On the ash-tree
Yggdrasil;
<END PAGE>
From above the words |
of the eagle he bears,
And tells them to
Nithhogg beneath.

33. Four harts there
are, | that the highest
twigs
Nibble with necks bent
back;
Dain and Dvalin, | . . . . .
.
<END PAGE>
Duneyr and Dyrathror.

34. More serpents
there are | beneath
the ash
Than an unwise ape
would think;
Goin and Moin, |
Grafvitnir's sons,
Grabak and
Grafvolluth,
<END PAGE>
Ofnir and Svafnir |
shall ever, methinks,
Gnaw at the twigs of
the tree.

35. Yggdrasil's ash |
great evil suffers,
Far more than men do
know;
The hart bites its top, |
its trunk is rotting,
<END PAGE>
And Nithhogg gnaws
beneath.

36. Hrist and Mist |
bring the horn at my
will,
Skeggjold and Skogul;
Hild and Thruth, | Hlok
and Herfjotur,
Gol and Geironul,
Randgrith and
Rathgrith | and
Reginleif
<END PAGE>
Beer to the warriors
bring.

37. Arvak and Alsvith |
up shall drag
Weary the weight of
the sun;
But an iron cool | have
the kindly gods
Of yore set under
their yokes.
<END PAGE>
38. In front of the sun
| does Svalin stand,
The shield for the
shining god;
Mountains and sea |
would be set in flames
If it fell from before
the sun.

<END PAGE>
39. Skoll is the wolf |
that to Ironwood
Follows the glittering
god,
And the son of
Hrothvitnir, | Hati,
awaits
The burning bride of
heaven.

<END PAGE>
40. Out of Ymir's flesh |
was fashioned the
earth,
And the ocean out of
his blood;
Of his bones the hills, |
of his hair the trees,
Of his skull the
heavens high.

<END PAGE>
41. Mithgarth the gods |
from his eyebrows
made,
And set for the sons
of men;
And out of his brain |
the baleful clouds
They made to move on
high.

<END PAGE>
42. His the favor of Ull
| and of all the gods
Who first in the flames
will reach;
For the house can be
seen | by the sons of
the gods
If the kettle aside
were cast.

<END PAGE>
43. In days of old | did
Ivaldi's sons
Skithblathnir fashion
fair,
The best of ships | for
the bright god Freyr,
The noble son of
Njorth.

<END PAGE>
44. The best of trees |
must Yggdrasil be,
Skithblathnir best of
boats;
Of all the gods | is
Othin the greatest,
And Sleipnir the best
of steeds;
Bifrost of bridges, |
Bragi of skalds,
Hobrok of hawks, | and
Garm of hounds.
<END PAGE>
45. To the race of the
gods | my face have I
raised,
And the wished-for aid
have I waked;
For to all the gods |
has the message gone
That sit in Ægir's
seats,
That drink within Ægir's
doors.
<END PAGE>
46. Grim is my name, |
Gangleri am 1,
Herjan and Hjalmberi,
Thekk and Thrithi, |
Thuth and Uth,
Helblindi and Hor;

47. Sath and Svipal |
and Sanngetal,
Herteit and Hnikar,
Bileyg, Baleyg, |
Bolverk, Fjolnir,
<END PAGE>
Grim and Grimnir, |
Glapsvith, Fjolsvith.

48. Sithhott, Sithskegg, |
Sigfather, Hnikuth,
Allfather, Valfather, |
Atrith, Farmatyr:
A single name | have I
never had
Since first among men I
fared.
<END PAGE>
49. Grimnir they call me
| in Geirröth's hall,
With Asmund Jalk am I;
Kjalar I was | when I
went in a sledge,
At the council Thror
am I called,
As Vithur I fare to the
fight;
Oski, Biflindi, | Jafnhor
and Omi,
<END PAGE>
Gondlir and Harbarth
midst gods.
So. I deceived the giant
| Sokkmimir old
As Svithur and Svithrir
of yore;
Of Mithvitnir's son | the
slayer I was
When the famed one
found his doom.

<END PAGE>
51. Drunk art thou,
Geirröth, | too much
didst thou drink,
. . . . . . . . . .
Much hast thou lost, |
for help no more
From me or my heroes
thou hast.

<END PAGE>
52. Small heed didst
thou take | to all that I
told,
And false were the
words of thy friends;
For now the sword | of
my friend I see,
That waits all wet with
blood.

<END PAGE>
53. Thy sword-pierced
body | shall Ygg have
soon,
For thy life is ended at
last;
The maids are hostile; |
now Othin behold!
Now come to me if thou
canst!

<END PAGE>
54. Now am I Othin, | Ygg
was I once,
Ere that did they call
me Thund;
Vak and Skilfing, |
Vofuth and Hroptatyr,
Gaut and Jalk midst the
gods;
Ofnir and Svafnir, | and
all, methinks,
Are names for none
but me.
<END PAGE>
King Geirröth sat and
had his sword on his
knee, half drawn from
its sheath. But when he
heard that
Othin was come thither,
then he rose up and
sought to take Othin
from the fire. The
sword slipped from
his hand, and fell with
the hilt down. The king
stumbled and fell
forward, and the
sword pierced him
<END PAGE>
