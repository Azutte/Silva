GRIMNISMOL
The Ballad of Grimnir
<END PAGE>
1. Hot art thou, fire! |
too fierce by far;
Get ye now gone, ye
flames!
The mantle is burnt, |
<END PAGE>
though I bear it aloft,
And the fire scorches
the fur.

2. 'Twixt the fires now |
eight nights have I sat,
<END PAGE>
And no man brought
meat to me,
Save Agnar alone, |
and alone shall rule
Geirröth's son o'er
<END PAGE>
the Goths.

3. Hail to thee, Agnar! |
for hailed thou art
By the voice of
Veratyr;
<END PAGE>
For a single drink |
shalt thou never
receive
A greater gift as
reward.

<END PAGE>
4. The land is holy |
that lies hard by
The gods and the
elves together;
And Thor shall ever |
<END PAGE>
in Thruthheim dwell,
Till the gods to
destruction go.

5. Ydalir call they | the
place where Ull
<END PAGE>
A hall for himself hath
set;
And Alfheim the gods |
to Freyr once gave
As a tooth-gift in
<END PAGE>
ancient times.

6. A third home is
there, | with silver
thatched
By the hands of the
<END PAGE>
gracious gods:
Valaskjolf is it, | in
days of old
Set by a god for
himself.

<END PAGE>
7. Sökkvabekk is the
fourth, | where cool
waves flow,
And amid their murmur
it stands;
There daily do Othin |
<END PAGE>
and Saga drink
In gladness from cups
of gold.

8. The fifth is
<END PAGE>
Glathsheim, | and
gold-bright there
Stands Valhall
stretching wide;
And there does Othin |
each day choose
The men who have
<END PAGE>
fallen in fight.

9. Easy is it to know |
for him who to Othin
Comes and beholds the
hall;
<END PAGE>
Its rafters are
spears, | with shields is
it roofed,
On its benches are
breastplates strewn.

<END PAGE>
10. Easy is it to know |
for him who to Othin
Comes and beholds the
hall;
There hangs a wolf |
<END PAGE>
by the western door,
And o'er it an eagle
hovers.

11. The sixth is
<END PAGE>
Thrymheim, | where
Thjazi dwelt,
The giant of marvelous
might;
Now Skathi abides, | the
god's fair bride,
In the home that her
<END PAGE>
father had.

12. The seventh is
Breithablik; | Baldr has
there
For himself a dwelling
<END PAGE>
set,
In the land I know |
that lies so fair,
And from evil fate is
free.

<END PAGE>
13. Himinbjorg is the
eighth, | and Heimdall
there
O'er men holds sway, it
is said;
In his well-built house |
<END PAGE>
does the warder of
heaven
The good mead gladly
drink.

14. The ninth is
<END PAGE>
Folkvang, | where
Freyja decrees
Who shall have seats in
the hall;
The half of the dead |
each day does she
<END PAGE>
choose,
And half does Othin
have.

15. The tenth is Glitnir;
| its pillars are gold,
<END PAGE>
And its roof with silver
is set;
There most of his days
| does Forseti dwell,
And sets all strife at
<END PAGE>
end.

16. The eleventh is
Noatun; | there has
Njorth
For himself a dwelling
<END PAGE>
set;
The sinless ruler | of
men there sits
In his temple timbered
high.

<END PAGE>
17. Filled with growing
trees | and
high-standing grass
Is Vithi, Vithar's land;
But there did the son |
<END PAGE>
from his steed leap
down,
When his father he fain
would avenge.

18. In Eldhrimnir |
<END PAGE>
Andhrimnir cooks
Sæhrimnir's seething
flesh,--
The best of food, | but
few men know
On what fare the
<END PAGE>
warriors feast.

19. Freki and Geri |
does Heerfather feed,
The far-famed fighter
of old:
<END PAGE>
But on wine alone |
does the
weapon-decked god,
Othin, forever live.

<END PAGE>
20. O'er Mithgarth
Hugin | and Munin both
Each day set forth to
fly;
For Hugin I fear | lest
<END PAGE>
he come not home,
But for Munin my care
is more.

21. Loud roars Thund, |
and Thjothvitnir's fish
<END PAGE>
joyously fares in the
flood;
Hard does it seem | to
the host of the slain
To wade the torrent
<END PAGE>
wild.

22. There Valgrind
stands, | the sacred
gate,
And behind are the
<END PAGE>
holy doors;
Old is the gate, | but
few there are
Who can tell how it
tightly is locked.

<END PAGE>
23. Five hundred doors
| and forty there are,
I ween, in Valhall's
walls;
Eight hundred fighters
<END PAGE>
| through one door
fare
When to war with the
wolf they go.

24. Five hundred rooms
<END PAGE>
| and forty there are
I ween, in Bilskirnir
built;
Of all the homes |
whose roofs I beheld,
My son's the greatest
<END PAGE>
meseemed.

25. Heithrun is the goat
| who stands by
Heerfather's hall,
And the branches of
<END PAGE>
Lærath she bites;
The pitcher she fills |
with the fair, clear
mead,
Ne'er fails the foaming
drink.
<END PAGE>
26. Eikthyrnir is the
hart | who stands by
Heerfather's hall
And the branches of
Lærath he bites;
From his horns a
<END PAGE>
stream | into
Hvergelmir drops,
Thence all the rivers
run.

27. Sith and Vith, | Sækin
<END PAGE>
and Ækin,
Svol and Fimbulthul, |
Gunnthro, and Fjorm,
Rin and Rinnandi,
Gipul and Gopul, | Gomul
and Geirvimul,
<END PAGE>
That flow through the
fields of the gods;
Thyn and Vin, | Thol
and Hol,
Groth and Gunnthorin.

<END PAGE>
28. Vino is one, |
Vegsvin another,
And Thjothnuma a
third;
Nyt and Not, | Non and
<END PAGE>
Hron,
Slith and Hrith, | Sylg
and Ylg,
Vith and Von, | Vond
and Strond,
Gjol and Leipt, | that
<END PAGE>
go among men,
And hence they fall to
Hel.

29. Kormt and Ormt |
and the Kerlaugs twain
<END PAGE>
Shall Thor each day
wade through,
(When dooms to give |
he forth shall go
To the ash-tree
<END PAGE>
Yggdrasil;)
For heaven's bridge |
burns all in flame,
And the sacred waters
seethe.

<END PAGE>
30. Glath and Gyllir, |
Gler and Skeithbrimir,
Silfrintopp and Sinir,
Gisl and Falhofnir, |
Golltopp and Lettfeti,
On these steeds the
<END PAGE>
gods shall go
When dooms to give |
each day they ride
To the ash-tree
Yggdrasil.

<END PAGE>
31. Three roots there
are | that three ways
run
Neath the ash-tree
Yggdrasil;
Neath the first lives
<END PAGE>
Hel, | 'neath the second
the frost-giants,
Neath the last are the
lands of men.

32. Ratatosk is the
<END PAGE>
squirrel | who there
shall run
On the ash-tree
Yggdrasil;
From above the words |
of the eagle he bears,
And tells them to
<END PAGE>
Nithhogg beneath.

33. Four harts there
are, | that the highest
twigs
Nibble with necks bent
<END PAGE>
back;
Dain and Dvalin, | . . . . .
.
Duneyr and Dyrathror.

<END PAGE>
34. More serpents
there are | beneath
the ash
Than an unwise ape
would think;
Goin and Moin, |
<END PAGE>
Grafvitnir's sons,
Grabak and
Grafvolluth,
Ofnir and Svafnir |
shall ever, methinks,
Gnaw at the twigs of
<END PAGE>
the tree.

35. Yggdrasil's ash |
great evil suffers,
Far more than men do
know;
<END PAGE>
The hart bites its top, |
its trunk is rotting,
And Nithhogg gnaws
beneath.

<END PAGE>
36. Hrist and Mist |
bring the horn at my
will,
Skeggjold and Skogul;
Hild and Thruth, | Hlok
<END PAGE>
and Herfjotur,
Gol and Geironul,
Randgrith and
Rathgrith | and
Reginleif
Beer to the warriors
<END PAGE>
bring.

37. Arvak and Alsvith |
up shall drag
Weary the weight of
the sun;
<END PAGE>
But an iron cool | have
the kindly gods
Of yore set under
their yokes.

<END PAGE>
38. In front of the sun
| does Svalin stand,
The shield for the
shining god;
Mountains and sea |
<END PAGE>
would be set in flames
If it fell from before
the sun.

39. Skoll is the wolf |
that to Ironwood
<END PAGE>
Follows the glittering
god,
And the son of
Hrothvitnir, | Hati,
awaits
The burning bride of
<END PAGE>
heaven.

40. Out of Ymir's flesh |
was fashioned the
earth,
And the ocean out of
<END PAGE>
his blood;
Of his bones the hills, |
of his hair the trees,
Of his skull the
heavens high.

<END PAGE>
41. Mithgarth the gods |
from his eyebrows
made,
And set for the sons
of men;
And out of his brain |
<END PAGE>
the baleful clouds
They made to move on
high.

42. His the favor of Ull
| and of all the gods
<END PAGE>
Who first in the flames
will reach;
For the house can be
seen | by the sons of
the gods
If the kettle aside
<END PAGE>
were cast.

43. In days of old | did
Ivaldi's sons
Skithblathnir fashion
fair,
<END PAGE>
The best of ships | for
the bright god Freyr,
The noble son of
Njorth.

<END PAGE>
44. The best of trees |
must Yggdrasil be,
Skithblathnir best of
boats;
Of all the gods | is
<END PAGE>
Othin the greatest,
And Sleipnir the best
of steeds;
Bifrost of bridges, |
Bragi of skalds,
Hobrok of hawks, | and
<END PAGE>
Garm of hounds.

45. To the race of the
gods | my face have I
raised,
And the wished-for aid
<END PAGE>
have I waked;
For to all the gods |
has the message gone
That sit in Ægir's
seats,
That drink within Ægir's
<END PAGE>
doors.

46. Grim is my name, |
Gangleri am 1,
Herjan and Hjalmberi,
Thekk and Thrithi, |
<END PAGE>
Thuth and Uth,
Helblindi and Hor;

47. Sath and Svipal |
and Sanngetal,
Herteit and Hnikar,
<END PAGE>
Bileyg, Baleyg, |
Bolverk, Fjolnir,
Grim and Grimnir, |
Glapsvith, Fjolsvith.

<END PAGE>
48. Sithhott, Sithskegg, |
Sigfather, Hnikuth,
Allfather, Valfather, |
Atrith, Farmatyr:
A single name | have I
<END PAGE>
never had
Since first among men I
fared.

49. Grimnir they call me
| in Geirröth's hall,
<END PAGE>
With Asmund Jalk am I;
Kjalar I was | when I
went in a sledge,
At the council Thror
am I called,
As Vithur I fare to the
<END PAGE>
fight;
Oski, Biflindi, | Jafnhor
and Omi,
Gondlir and Harbarth
midst gods.
So. I deceived the giant
<END PAGE>
| Sokkmimir old
As Svithur and Svithrir
of yore;
Of Mithvitnir's son | the
slayer I was
When the famed one
<END PAGE>
found his doom.

51. Drunk art thou,
Geirröth, | too much
didst thou drink,
. . . . . . . . . .
<END PAGE>
Much hast thou lost, |
for help no more
From me or my heroes
thou hast.

<END PAGE>
52. Small heed didst
thou take | to all that I
told,
And false were the
words of thy friends;
For now the sword | of
<END PAGE>
my friend I see,
That waits all wet with
blood.

53. Thy sword-pierced
<END PAGE>
body | shall Ygg have
soon,
For thy life is ended at
last;
The maids are hostile; |
now Othin behold!
Now come to me if thou
<END PAGE>
canst!

54. Now am I Othin, | Ygg
was I once,
Ere that did they call
me Thund;
<END PAGE>
Vak and Skilfing, |
Vofuth and Hroptatyr,
Gaut and Jalk midst the
gods;
Ofnir and Svafnir, | and
<END PAGE>
all, methinks,
Are names for none
but me.
King Geirröth sat and
<END PAGE>
had his sword on his
knee, half drawn from
its sheath. But when he
heard that
Othin was come thither,
then he rose up and
<END PAGE>
sought to take Othin
from the fire. The
sword slipped from
his hand, and fell with
the hilt down. The king
stumbled and fell
<END PAGE>
