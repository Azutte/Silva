LOKASENNA
Loki's Wrangling
<END PAGE>
1. "Speak now, Eldir, |
for not one step
Farther shalt thou
fare;
What ale-talk here | do
<END PAGE>
they have within,
The sons of the
glorious gods?"

Eldir spake:
2. "Of their weapons
<END PAGE>
they talk, | and their
might in war,
The sons of the
glorious gods;
From the gods and
elves | who are
<END PAGE>
gathered here
No friend in words
shalt thou find."

Loki spake:
3. "In shall I go | into
<END PAGE>
Ægir's hall,
For the feast I fain
would see;
Bale and hatred | I
bring to the gods,
And their mead with
<END PAGE>
venom I mix."

Eldir spake:
4. "If in thou goest | to
Ægir's hall,
And fain the feast
<END PAGE>
wouldst see,
And with slander and
spite | wouldst sprinkle
the gods,
Think well lest they
wipe it on thee."
<END PAGE>
Loki spake:
5. "Bethink thee, Eldir, |
if thou and I
Shall strive with
spiteful speech;
Richer I grow | in
<END PAGE>
ready words
If thou speakest too
much to me."
Then Loki went into the
<END PAGE>
hall, but when they who
were there saw who
had entered, they were
all silent.

Loki spake:
6. "Thirsty I come | into
<END PAGE>
this thine hall,
I, Lopt, from a journey
long,
To ask of the gods |
that one should give
Fair mead for a drink
<END PAGE>
to me.

7. "Why sit ye silent, |
swollen with pride,
Ye gods, and no
answer give?
<END PAGE>
At your feast a place |
and a seat prepare me,
Or bid me forth to
fare."

<END PAGE>
Bragi spake:
8. "A place and a seat |
will the gods prepare
No more in their midst
for thee;
For the gods know well
<END PAGE>
| what men they wish
To find at their mighty
feasts."

Loki spake:
9. "Remember, Othin, | in
<END PAGE>
olden days
That we both our blood
have mixed;
Then didst thou
promise | no ale to
pour,
<END PAGE>
Unless it were brought
for us both."

Othin spake:
10. "Stand forth then,
<END PAGE>
Vithar, | and let the
wolf's father
Find a seat at our
feast;
Lest evil should Loki |
speak aloud
Here within Ægir's hall."
<END PAGE>
Then Vithar arose and
poured drink for Loki;
but before he drank
he spoke to the gods:

<END PAGE>
11. "Hail to you, gods! |
ye goddesses, hail!
Hail to the holy throng!
Save for the god | who
yonder sits,
Bragi there on the
<END PAGE>
bench."

Bragi spake:
12. "A horse and a
sword | from my hoard
will I give,
<END PAGE>
And a ring gives Bragi
to boot,
That hatred thou makst
not | among the gods;
So rouse not the great
<END PAGE>
ones to wrath."

Loki spake:
13. "In horses and
rings | thou shalt
never be rich,
<END PAGE>
Bragi, but both shalt
thou lack;
Of the gods and elves |
here together met
Least brave in battle
<END PAGE>
art thou,
(And shyest thou art
of the shot.)"

Bragi spake:
14. "Now were I without
<END PAGE>
| as I am within,
And here in Ægir's hall,
Thine head would I
bear | in mine hands
away,
And pay thee the price
<END PAGE>
of thy lies."

Loki spake:
15. "In thy seat art
thou bold, | not so are
thy deeds,
<END PAGE>
Bragi, adorner of
benches!
Go out and fight | if
angered thou feelest,
No hero such
<END PAGE>
forethought has."

Ithun spake:
16. "Well, prithee, Bragi,
| his kinship weigh,
Since chosen as
<END PAGE>
wish-son he was;
And speak not to Loki |
such words of spite
Here within Ægir's hall."

<END PAGE>
Loki spake:
17. "Be silent, Ithun! |
thou art, I say,
Of women most lustful
in love,
Since thou thy
<END PAGE>
washed-bright | arms
didst wind
About thy brother's
slayer."

Ithun spake:
18. "To Loki I speak
<END PAGE>
not | with spiteful
words
Here within Ægir's hall;
And Bragi I calm, | who
is hot with beer,
For I wish not that
<END PAGE>
fierce they should
fight."

Gefjun spake:
19. "Why, ye gods twain,
| with bitter tongues
Raise hate among us
<END PAGE>
here?
Loki is famed | for his
mockery foul,
And the dwellers in
heaven he hates."

<END PAGE>
Loki spake:
20. "Be silent, Gefjun! |
for now shall I say
Who led thee to evil
life;
The boy so fair | gave
<END PAGE>
a necklace bright,
And about him thy leg
was laid."

Othin spake:
21. "Mad art thou, Loki,
<END PAGE>
| and little of wit,
The wrath of Gefjun to
rouse;
For the fate that is
set | for all she sees,
Even as I, methinks."
<END PAGE>
Loki spake:
22. "Be silent, Othin! |
not justly thou settest
The fate of the fight
among men;
Oft gavst thou to him |
<END PAGE>
who deserved not the
gift,
To the baser, the
battle's prize."

Othin spake:
23. "Though I gave to
<END PAGE>
him | who deserved not
the gift,
To the baser, the
battle's prize;
Winters eight | wast
thou under the earth,
Milking the cows as a
<END PAGE>
maid,
(Ay, and babes didst
thou bear;
Unmanly thy soul must
seem.)"

<END PAGE>
Loki spake:
24. "They say that with
spells | in Samsey once
Like witches with
charms didst thou
<END PAGE>
work;
And in witch's guise |
among men didst thou
go;
Unmanly thy soul must
seem."
<END PAGE>
Frigg spake:
25. "Of the deeds ye
two | of old have done
Ye should make no
speech among men;
Whate'er ye have done
<END PAGE>
| in days gone by,
Old tales should ne'er
be told."

Loki spake:
26. "Be silent, Frigg! |
<END PAGE>
thou art Fjorgyn's
wife,
But ever lustful in
love;
For Vili and Ve, | thou
wife of Vithrir,
Both in thy bosom have
<END PAGE>
lain."

Frigg spake:
27. "If a son like Baldr
| were by me now,
Here within Ægir's hall,
<END PAGE>
From the sons of the
gods | thou shouldst
go not forth
Till thy fierceness in
fight were tried."

<END PAGE>
Loki spake:
28. "Thou wilt then,
Frigg, | that further I
tell
Of the ill that now I
<END PAGE>
know;
Mine is the blame | that
Baldr no more
Thou seest ride home
to the hall."

<END PAGE>
Freyja spake:
29. "Mad art thou, Loki,
| that known thou
makest
The wrong and shame
<END PAGE>
thou hast wrought;
The fate of all | does
Frigg know well,
Though herself she
says it not."

<END PAGE>
Loki spake:
30. "Be silent, Freyja! |
for fully I know thee,
Sinless thou art not
thyself;
Of the gods and elves |
<END PAGE>
who are gathered
here,
Each one as thy lover
has lain."

Freyja spake:
31. "False is thy
<END PAGE>
tongue, | and soon
shalt thou find
That it sings thee an
evil song;
The gods are wroth, |
and the goddesses all,
And in grief shalt thou
<END PAGE>
homeward go."

Loki spake:
32. "Be silent, Freyja! |
thou foulest witch,
And steeped full sore
<END PAGE>
in sin;
In the arms of thy
brother | the bright
gods caught thee
When Freyja her wind
set free."
<END PAGE>
Njorth spake:
33. "Small ill does it
work | though a woman
may have
A lord or a lover or
<END PAGE>
both;
But a wonder it is | that
this womanish god
Comes hither, though
babes he has borne."

<END PAGE>
Loki spake:
34. "Be silent, Njorth; |
thou wast eastward
sent,
To the gods as a
<END PAGE>
hostage given;
And the daughters of
Hymir | their privy had
When use did they make
of thy mouth."

<END PAGE>
Njorth spake:
35. "Great was my gain,
| though long was I
gone,
To the gods as a
<END PAGE>
hostage given;
The son did I have |
whom no man hates,
And foremost of gods
is found."

<END PAGE>
Loki spake:
36. "Give heed now,
Njorth, | nor boast too
high,
No longer I hold it hid;
With thy sister hadst
<END PAGE>
thou | so fair a son,
Thus hadst thou no
worse a hope."

Tyr spake:
37. "Of the heroes
<END PAGE>
brave | is Freyr the
best
Here in the home of
the gods;
He harms not maids |
nor the wives of men,
And the bound from
<END PAGE>
their fetters he
frees."

Loki spake:
38. "Be silent, Tyr! |
for between two men
Friendship thou ne'er
<END PAGE>
couldst fashion;
Fain would I tell | how
Fenrir once
Thy right hand rent
from thee."

<END PAGE>
Tyr spake:
39. "My hand do I lack,
| but Hrothvitnir thou,
And the loss brings
longing to both;
Ill fares the wolf | who
<END PAGE>
shall ever await
In fetters the fall of
the gods."

Loki spake:
40. "Be silent, Tyr! |
<END PAGE>
for a son with me
Thy wife once chanced
to win;
Not a penny, methinks, |
wast thou paid for the
wrong,
<END PAGE>
Nor wast righted an
inch, poor wretch."

Freyr spake:
41. "By the mouth of
<END PAGE>
the river | the wolf
remains
Till the gods to
destruction go;
Thou too shalt soon, |
if thy tongue is not
<END PAGE>
stilled,
Be fettered, thou
forger of ill."

Loki spake:
42. "The daughter of
<END PAGE>
Gymir | with gold didst
thou buy,
And sold thy sword to
boot;
But when Muspell's
sons | through
<END PAGE>
Myrkwood ride,
Thou shalt weaponless
wait, poor wretch."

Byggvir spake:
43. "Had I birth so
<END PAGE>
famous | as
Ingunar-Freyr,
And sat in so lofty a
seat,
I would crush to
marrow | this croaker
<END PAGE>
of ill,
And beat all his body
to bits."

Loki spake:
44. "What little
<END PAGE>
creature | goes
crawling there,
Snuffling and snapping
about?
At Freyr's ears ever |
wilt thou be found,
Or muttering hard at
<END PAGE>
the mill."

Byggvir spake:
45. "Byggvir my name, |
and nimble am I,
As gods and men do
<END PAGE>
grant;
And here am I proud |
that the children of
Hropt
Together all drink ale."

<END PAGE>
Loki spake:
46. "Be silent, Byggvir! |
thou never couldst set
Their shares of the
meat for men;
Hid in straw on the
<END PAGE>
floor, | they found
thee not
When heroes were fain
to fight."

Heimdall spake:
47. "Drunk art thou,
<END PAGE>
Loki, | and mad are thy
deeds,
Why, Loki, leavst thou
this not?
For drink beyond
measure | will lead all
<END PAGE>
men
No thought of their
tongues to take."

Loki spake:
48. "Be silent, Heimdall! |
<END PAGE>
in days long since
Was an evil fate for
thee fixed;
With back held stiff |
must thou ever stand,
As warder of heaven
<END PAGE>
to watch."

Skathi spake:
49. "Light art thou,
Loki, | but longer thou
mayst not
<END PAGE>
In freedom flourish
thy tail;
On the rocks the gods
bind thee | with bowels
torn
Forth from thy
<END PAGE>
frost-cold son."

Loki spake:
50. "Though on rocks
the gods bind me | with
bowels torn
<END PAGE>
Forth from my
frost-cold son,
I was first and last | at
the deadly fight
There where Thjazi we
<END PAGE>
caught."

Skathi spake:
51. "Wert thou first
and last | at the deadly
fight
<END PAGE>
There where Thjazi
was caught,
From my dwellings and
fields | shall ever come
forth
A counsel cold for
<END PAGE>
thee."

Loki spake:
52. "More lightly thou
spakest | with Laufey's
son,
<END PAGE>
When thou badst me
come to thy bed;
Such things must be
known | if now we two
Shall seek our sins to
<END PAGE>
tell."
Then Sif came forward
and poured mead for
Loki in a crystal cup,
and said:

<END PAGE>
53. "Hail too thee, Loki,
| and take thou here
The crystal cup of old
mead;
For me at least, | alone
<END PAGE>
of the gods,
Blameless thou knowest
to be."
He took the horn, and
drank therefrom:

<END PAGE>
54. "Alone thou wert |
if truly thou wouldst
All men so shyly shun;
But one do I know | full
well, methinks,
Who had thee from
<END PAGE>
Hlorrithi's arms,--
(Loki the crafty in
lies.)"

Beyla spake:
55. "The mountains
<END PAGE>
shake, | and surely I
think
From his home comes
Hlorrithi now;
He will silence the man |
who is slandering here
Together both gods
<END PAGE>
and men."

Loki spake:
56. "Be silent, Beyla! |
thou art Byggvir's wife,
And deep art thou
<END PAGE>
steeped in sin;
A greater shame | to
the gods came ne'er,
Befouled thou art with
thy filth."

<END PAGE>
Then came Thor forth,
and spake:
57. "Unmanly one,
cease, | or the mighty
hammer,
Mjollnir, shall close
<END PAGE>
thy mouth;
Thy shoulder-cliff |
shall I cleave from thy
neck,
And so shall thy life be
lost."
<END PAGE>
Loki spake:
58. "Lo, in has come |
the son of Earth:
Why threaten so loudly,
Thor?
Less fierce thou shalt
<END PAGE>
go | to fight with the
wolf
When he swallows
Sigfather up."

Thor spake:
59. "Unmanly one,
<END PAGE>
cease, | or the mighty
hammer,
Mjollnir, shall close
thy mouth;
I shall hurl thee up |
and out in the East,
Where men shall see
<END PAGE>
thee no more."

Loki spake:
60. "That thou hast
fared | on the
East-road forth
<END PAGE>
To men shouldst thou
say no more;
In the thumb of a glove
| didst thou hide, thou
great one,
And there forgot thou
<END PAGE>
wast Thor."

Thor spake:
61. "Unmanly one,
cease, | or the mighty
hammer,
<END PAGE>
Mjollnir, shall close
thy mouth;
My right hand shall
smite thee | with
Hrungnir's slayer,
Till all thy bones are
<END PAGE>
broken."

Loki spake:
62. "Along time still | do
I think to live,
Though thou
<END PAGE>
threatenest thus with
thy hammer;
Rough seemed the
straps | of Skrymir's
wallet,
When thy meat thou
<END PAGE>
mightest not get,
(And faint from hunger
didst feel.)"

Thor spake:
63. "Unmanly one,
<END PAGE>
cease, | or the mighty
hammer,
Mjollnir, shall close
thy mouth;
The slayer of Hrungnir
| shall send thee to
<END PAGE>
hell,
And down to the gate
of death."

Loki spake:
64. "'1 have said to the
<END PAGE>
gods | and the sons of
the god,
The things that whetted
my thoughts;
But before thee alone |
do I now go forth,
For thou fightest well,
<END PAGE>
I ween.

65. "Ale hast thou
brewed, | but, Ægir, now
Such feasts shalt thou
make no more;
<END PAGE>
O'er all that thou hast
| which is here within
Shall play the
flickering flames,
(And thy back shall be
<END PAGE>
burnt with fire.)"
And after that Loki hid
himself in Franang's
waterfall in the guise
of a salmon, and there
the gods took
<END PAGE>
him. He was bound with
the bowels of his son
Vali, but his son Narfi
was changed to a wolf.
Skathi took
a poison-snake and
<END PAGE>
fastened it up over
Loki's face, and the
poison dropped
thereon. Sigyn, Loki's
wife,
sat there and held a
<END PAGE>
shell under the poison,
but when the shell was
full she bore away the
poison, and
meanwhile the poison
dropped on Loki. Then
<END PAGE>
