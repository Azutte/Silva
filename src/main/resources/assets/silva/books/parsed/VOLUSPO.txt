VOLUSPO
The Wise-Woman's Prophecy
<END PAGE>
1. Hearing I ask | from
the holy races,
From Heimdall's sons, |
both high and low;
Thou wilt, Valfather, |
<END PAGE>
that well I relate
Old tales I remember |
of men long ago.

2. I remember yet | the
giants of yore,
<END PAGE>
Who gave me bread | in
the days gone by;
Nine worlds I knew, |
the nine in the tree
With mighty roots |
<END PAGE>
beneath the mold.

3. Of old was the age |
when Ymir lived;
Sea nor cool waves |
nor sand there were;
<END PAGE>
Earth had not been, |
nor heaven above,
But a yawning gap, |
and grass nowhere.

<END PAGE>
4. Then Bur's sons
lifted | the level land,
Mithgarth the mighty |
there they made;
The sun from the
<END PAGE>
south | warmed the
stones of earth,
And green was the
ground | with growing
leeks.

<END PAGE>
5. The sun, the sister |
of the moon, from the
south
Her right hand cast |
over heaven's rim;
No knowledge she had |
<END PAGE>
where her home should
be,
The moon knew not |
what might was his,
The stars knew not |
where their stations
<END PAGE>
were.

6. Then sought the
gods | their
assembly-seats,
The holy ones, | and
<END PAGE>
council held;
Names then gave they |
to noon and twilight,
Morning they named, |
and the waning moon,
Night and evening, | the
<END PAGE>
years to number.

7. At Ithavoll met | the
mighty gods,
Shrines and temples |
they timbered high;
<END PAGE>
Forges they set, and |
they smithied ore,
Tongs they wrought, |
and tools they
fashioned.

<END PAGE>
8. In their dwellings at
peace | they played at
tables,
Of gold no lack | did
the gods then know,--
Till thither came | up
<END PAGE>
giant-maids three,
Huge of might, | out of
Jotunheim.

9. Then sought the
<END PAGE>
gods | their
assembly-seats,
The holy ones, | and
council held,
To find who should
raise | the race of
<END PAGE>
dwarfs
Out of Brimir's blood |
and the legs of Blain.

10. There was
<END PAGE>
Motsognir | the
mightiest made
Of all the dwarfs, | and
Durin next;
Many a likeness | of
men they made,
The dwarfs in the
<END PAGE>
earth, | as Durin said.

11. Nyi and Nithi, |
Northri and Suthri,
Austri and Vestri, |
Althjof, Dvalin,
<END PAGE>
Nar and Nain, | Niping,
Dain,
Bifur, Bofur, | Bombur,
Nori,
An and Onar, | Ai,
<END PAGE>
Mjothvitnir.

12. Vigg and Gandalf) |
Vindalf, Thrain,
Thekk and Thorin, |
Thror, Vit and Lit,
<END PAGE>
Nyr and Nyrath,-- |
now have I told--
Regin and Rathsvith-- |
the list aright.

<END PAGE>
13. Fili, Kili, | Fundin,
Nali,
Heptifili, | Hannar, Sviur,
Frar, Hornbori, | Fræg
and Loni,
Aurvang, Jari, |
<END PAGE>
Eikinskjaldi.

14. The race of the
dwarfs | in Dvalin's
throng
Down to Lofar | the list
<END PAGE>
must I tell;
The rocks they left, |
and through wet lands
They sought a home | in
the fields of sand.

<END PAGE>
15. There were
Draupnir | and
Dolgthrasir,
Hor, Haugspori, |
Hlevang, Gloin,
Dori, Ori, | Duf, Andvari,
<END PAGE>
Skirfir, Virfir, | Skafith,
Ai.

16. Alf and Yngvi, |
Eikinskjaldi,
Fjalar and Frosti, |
<END PAGE>
Fith and Ginnar;
So for all time | shall
the tale be known,
The list of all | the
forbears of Lofar.

<END PAGE>
17. Then from the
throng | did three come
forth,
From the home of the
gods, | the mighty and
<END PAGE>
gracious;
Two without fate | on
the land they found,
Ask and Embla, | empty
of might.

<END PAGE>
18. Soul they had not, |
sense they had not,
Heat nor motion, | nor
goodly hue;
Soul gave Othin, |
<END PAGE>
sense gave Hönir,
Heat gave Lothur | and
goodly hue.

19. An ash I know, |
Yggdrasil its name,
<END PAGE>
With water white | is the
great tree wet;
Thence come the dews |
that fall in the dales,
Green by Urth's well |
<END PAGE>
does it ever grow.

20. Thence come the
maidens | mighty in
wisdom,
Three from the
<END PAGE>
dwelling | down 'neath
the tree;
Urth is one named, |
Verthandi the next,--
On the wood they
scored,-- | and Skuld
<END PAGE>
the third.
Laws they made there,
and life allotted
To the sons of men,
and set their fates.

<END PAGE>
21. The war I
remember, | the first in
the world,
When the gods with
spears | had smitten
<END PAGE>
Gollveig,
And in the hall | of Hor
had burned her,
Three times burned, |
and three times born,
Oft and again, | yet
<END PAGE>
ever she lives.

22. Heith they named
her | who sought their
home,
The wide-seeing witch, |
<END PAGE>
in magic wise;
Minds she bewitched |
that were moved by
her magic,
To evil women | a joy
she was.
<END PAGE>
23. On the host his
spear | did Othin hurl,
Then in the world | did
war first come;
The wall that girdled |
<END PAGE>
the gods was broken,
And the field by the
warlike | Wanes was
trodden.

<END PAGE>
24. Then sought the
gods | their
assembly-seats,
The holy ones, | and
council held,
Whether the gods |
<END PAGE>
should tribute give,
Or to all alike | should
worship belong.

25. Then sought the
<END PAGE>
gods | their
assembly-seats,
The holy ones, | and
council held,
To find who with venom
| the air had filled,
Or had given Oth's
<END PAGE>
bride | to the giants'
brood.

26. In swelling rage |
then rose up Thor,--
Seldom he sits | when
<END PAGE>
he such things
hears,--
And the oaths were
broken, | the words
and bonds,
The mighty pledges |
<END PAGE>
between them made.

27. I know of the horn |
of Heimdall, hidden
Under the
<END PAGE>
high-reaching | holy
tree;
On it there pours |
from Valfather's
pledge
A mighty stream: | would
<END PAGE>
you know yet more?

28. Alone I sat | when
the Old One sought me,
The terror of gods, |
and gazed in mine eyes:
<END PAGE>
What hast thou to ask?
| why comest thou
hither?
Othin, I know | where
thine eye is hidden.

<END PAGE>
29. I know where
Othin's | eye is hidden,
Deep in the wide-famed
| well of Mimir;
Mead from the pledge |
<END PAGE>
of Othin each mom
Does Mimir drink: | would
you know yet more?

30. Necklaces had I |
<END PAGE>
and rings from
Heerfather,
Wise was my speech |
and my magic wisdom;
. . . . . . . . . .
Widely I saw | over all
<END PAGE>
the worlds.

31. On all sides saw I |
Valkyries assemble,
Ready to ride | to the
ranks of the gods;
<END PAGE>
Skuld bore the shield, |
and Skogul rode next,
Guth, Hild, Gondul, | and
Geirskogul.
Of Herjan's maidens |
<END PAGE>
the list have ye heard,
Valkyries ready | to
ride o'er the earth.

32. I saw for Baldr, |
the bleeding god,
<END PAGE>
The son of Othin, | his
destiny set:
Famous and fair | in
the lofty fields,
Full grown in strength |
<END PAGE>
the mistletoe stood.

33. From the branch
which seemed | so
slender and fair
Came a harmful shaft |
<END PAGE>
that Hoth should hurl;
But the brother of
Baldr | was born ere
long,
And one night old |
fought Othin's son.
<END PAGE>
34. His hands he
washed not, | his hair
he combed not,
Till he bore to the
bale-blaze | Baldr's
<END PAGE>
foe.
But in Fensalir | did
Frigg weep sore
For Valhall's need: |
would you know yet
more?
<END PAGE>
35. One did I see | in
the wet woods bound,
A lover of ill, | and to
Loki like;
By his side does Sigyn |
<END PAGE>
sit, nor is glad
To see her mate: |
would you know yet
more?

<END PAGE>
36. From the east
there pours | through
poisoned vales
With swords and
daggers | the river
<END PAGE>
Slith.
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

37. Northward a hall |
in Nithavellir
<END PAGE>
Of gold there rose |
for Sindri's race;
And in Okolnir | another
stood,
Where the giant Brimir |
<END PAGE>
his beer-hall had.

38. A hall I saw, | far
from the sun,
On Nastrond it stands, |
<END PAGE>
and the doors face
north,
Venom drops | through
the smoke-vent down,
For around the walls |
do serpents wind.

<END PAGE>
39. I saw there wading |
through rivers wild
Treacherous men | and
murderers too,
And workers of ill | with
<END PAGE>
the wives of men;
There Nithhogg sucked
| the blood of the slain,
And the wolf tore men; |
would you know yet
more?
<END PAGE>
40. The giantess old |
in Ironwood sat,
In the east, and bore |
the brood of Fenrir;
Among these one | in
<END PAGE>
monster's guise
Was soon to steal | the
sun from the sky.

41. There feeds he full
<END PAGE>
| on the flesh of the
dead,
And the home of the
gods | he reddens with
gore;
Dark grows the sun, |
<END PAGE>
and in summer soon
Come mighty storms: |
would you know yet
more?

<END PAGE>
42. On a hill there sat, |
and smote on his harp,
Eggther the joyous, |
the giants' warder;
Above him the cock | in
<END PAGE>
the bird-wood crowed,
Fair and red | did
Fjalar stand.

43. Then to the gods |
crowed Gollinkambi,
<END PAGE>
He wakes the heroes |
in Othin's hall;
And beneath the earth
| does another crow,
The rust-red bird | at
<END PAGE>
the bars of Hel.

44. Now Garm howls
loud | before
Gnipahellir,
The fetters will burst, |
<END PAGE>
and the wolf run free;
Much do I know, | and
more can see
Of the fate of the
gods, | the mighty in
fight.
<END PAGE>
45. Brothers shall
fight | and fell each
other,
And sisters' sons |
shall kinship stain;
Hard is it on earth, |
<END PAGE>
with mighty whoredom;
Axe-time, sword-time, |
shields are sundered,
Wind-time, wolf-time, |
ere the world falls;
Nor ever shall men |
<END PAGE>
each other spare.

46. Fast move the sons
| of Mim, and fate
Is heard in the note |
of the Gjallarhorn;
<END PAGE>
Loud blows Heimdall, |
the horn is aloft,
In fear quake all | who
on Hel-roads are.

<END PAGE>
47. Yggdrasil shakes, |
and shiver on high
The ancient limbs, | and
the giant is loose;
To the head of Mim |
<END PAGE>
does Othin give heed,
But the kinsman of Surt
| shall slay him soon.

48. How fare the gods?
| how fare the elves?
<END PAGE>
All Jotunheim groans, |
the gods are at
council;
Loud roar the dwarfs |
by the doors of stone,
The masters of the
<END PAGE>
rocks: | would you know
yet more?

49. Now Garm howls
loud | before
Gnipahellir,
The fetters will burst, |
<END PAGE>
and the wolf run free
Much do I know, | and
more can see
Of the fate of the
gods, | the mighty in
fight.
<END PAGE>
50. From the east
comes Hrym | with
shield held high;
In giant-wrath | does
the serpent writhe;
O'er the waves he
<END PAGE>
twists, | and the tawny
eagle
Gnaws corpses
screaming; | Naglfar is
loose.

<END PAGE>
51. O'er the sea from
the north | there sails
a ship
With the people of Hel, |
at the helm stands Loki;
After the wolf | do wild
<END PAGE>
men follow,
And with them the
brother | of Byleist
goes.

<END PAGE>
52. Surt fares from
the south | with the
scourge of branches,
The sun of the
battle-gods | shone
<END PAGE>
from his sword;
The crags are
sundered, | the
giant-women sink,
The dead throng
<END PAGE>
Hel-way, | and heaven
is cloven.

53. Now comes to Hlin |
yet another hurt,
When Othin fares | to
<END PAGE>
fight with the wolf,
And Beli's fair slayer |
seeks out Surt,
For there must fall |
the joy of Frigg.

<END PAGE>
54. Then comes
Sigfather's | mighty
son,
Vithar, to fight | with
the foaming wolf;
In the giant's son |
<END PAGE>
does he thrust his
sword
Full to the heart: | his
father is avenged.

55. Hither there comes
<END PAGE>
| the son of Hlothyn,
The bright snake
gapes | to heaven
above;
. . . . . . . . . .
Against the serpent |
<END PAGE>
goes Othin's son.

56. In anger smites |
the warder of earth,--
Forth from their homes
| must all men flee;-
<END PAGE>
Nine paces fares | the
son of Fjorgyn,
And, slain by the
serpent, | fearless he
sinks.

<END PAGE>
57. The sun turns
black, | earth sinks in
the sea,
The hot stars down |
from heaven are
<END PAGE>
whirled;
Fierce grows the steam
| and the life-feeding
flame,
Till fire leaps high |
about heaven itself.
<END PAGE>
58. Now Garm howls
loud | before
Gnipahellir,
The fetters will burst, |
and the wolf run free;
Much do I know, | and
<END PAGE>
more can see
Of the fate of the
gods, | the mighty in
fight.

<END PAGE>
59. Now do I see | the
earth anew
Rise all green | from
the waves again;
The cataracts fall, |
<END PAGE>
and the eagle flies,
And fish he catches |
beneath the cliffs.

60. The gods in Ithavoll
| meet together,
<END PAGE>
Of the terrible girdler
| of earth they talk,
And the mighty past |
they call to mind,
And the ancient runes |
<END PAGE>
of the Ruler of Gods.

61. In wondrous beauty
| once again
Shall the golden tables
| stand mid the grass,
<END PAGE>
Which the gods had
owned | in the days of
old,
. . . . . . . . . .

<END PAGE>
62. Then fields
unsowed | bear ripened
fruit,
All ills grow better, |
and Baldr comes back;
Baldr and Hoth dwell |
<END PAGE>
in Hropt's battle-hall,
And the mighty gods: |
would you know yet
more?

<END PAGE>
63. Then Hönir wins |
the prophetic wand,
. . . . . . . . . .
And the sons of the
brothers | of Tveggi
<END PAGE>
abide
In Vindheim now: | would
you know yet more?

64. More fair than the
sun, | a hall I see,
<END PAGE>
Roofed with gold, | on
Gimle it stands;
There shall the
righteous | rulers
dwell,
And happiness ever |
<END PAGE>
there shall they have.

65. There comes on
high, | all power to
hold,
A mighty lord, | all
<END PAGE>
lands he rules.
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

66. From below the
<END PAGE>
dragon | dark comes
forth,
Nithhogg flying | from
Nithafjoll;
The bodies of men on |
his wings he bears,
The serpent bright: |
<END PAGE>
