GUTHRUNARKVITHA I
The First Lay of Guthrun
<END PAGE>
1. Then did Guthrun |
think to die,
When she by Sigurth |
sorrowing sat;
Tears she had not, |
<END PAGE>
nor wrung her hands,
Nor ever wailed, | as
other women.

2. To her the warriors
| wise there came,
<END PAGE>
Longing her heavy |
woe to lighten;
Grieving could not |
Guthrun weep,
So sad her heart, | it
<END PAGE>
seemed, would break.

3. Then the wives | of
the warriors came,
Gold-adorned, | and
Guthrun sought;
<END PAGE>
Each one then | of her
own grief spoke,
The bitterest pain | she
had ever borne.

<END PAGE>
4. Then spake
Gjaflaug, | Gjuki's
sister:
Most joyless of all | on
earth am I;
Husbands five | were
<END PAGE>
from me taken,
(Two daughters then, |
and sisters three,)
Brothers eight, | yet I
have lived.

<END PAGE>
5. Grieving could not |
Guthrun weep,
Such grief she had |
for her husband dead,
And so grim her heart |
<END PAGE>
by the hero's body.

6. Then Herborg spake,
| the queen of the
Huns:
I have a greater |
<END PAGE>
grief to tell;
My seven sons | in the
southern land,
And my husband, fell |
in fight all eight.
(Father and mother |
<END PAGE>
and brothers four
Amid the waves | the
wind once smote,
And the seas crashed
through | the sides of
the ship.)
<END PAGE>
7. The bodies all | with
my own hands then
I decked for the
grave, | and the dead I
buried;
A half-year brought
<END PAGE>
me | this to bear;
And no one came | to
comfort me.

8. "Then bound I was, |
and taken in war,
<END PAGE>
A sorrow yet | in the
same half-year;
They bade me deck |
and bind the shoes
Of the wife of the
<END PAGE>
monarch | every morn.

9. "In jealous rage |
her wrath she spake,
And beat me oft | with
heavy blows;
<END PAGE>
Never a better | lord I
knew,
And never a woman |
worse I found."

<END PAGE>
10. Grieving could not |
Guthrun weep,
Such grief she had |
for her husband dead,
And so grim her heart |
<END PAGE>
by the hero's body.

11. Then spake
Gollrond, | Gjuki's
daughter:
Thy wisdom finds not, |
<END PAGE>
my foster-mother,
The way to comfort |
the wife so young.
She bade them uncover
| the warrior's corpse.

<END PAGE>
12. The shroud she
lifted | from Sigurth,
laying
His well-loved head |
on the knees of his
<END PAGE>
wife:
Look on thy loved one,
| and lay thy lips
To his as if yet | the
hero lived.

<END PAGE>
13. Once alone did |
Guthrun look;
His hair all clotted |
with blood beheld,
The blinded eyes | that
<END PAGE>
once shone bright,
The hero's breast |
that the blade had
pierced.

<END PAGE>
14. Then Guthrun bent,
| on her pillow bowed,
Her hair was loosened,
| her cheek was hot,
And the tears like
<END PAGE>
raindrops | downward
ran.

15. Then Guthrun,
daughter | of Gjuki,
wept,
And through her
<END PAGE>
tresses | flowed the
tears;
And from the court |
came the cry of geese,
The birds so fair | of
the hero's bride.

<END PAGE>
16. Then Gollrond
spake, | the daughter
of Gjuki:
Never a greater | love
I knew
Than yours among | all
<END PAGE>
men on earth;
Nowhere wast happy, |
at home or abroad,
Sister mine, | with
Sigurth away.

<END PAGE>
Guthrun spake:
17. "So was my Sigurth
| o'er Gjuki's sons
As the spear-leek
grown | above the
<END PAGE>
grass,
Or the jewel bright |
borne on the band,
The precious stone |
that princes wear.

<END PAGE>
18. "To the leader of
men | I loftier seemed
And higher than all | of
Herjan's maids;
As little now | as the
<END PAGE>
leaf I am
On the willow hanging; |
my hero is dead.

19. "In his seat, in his
bed, | I see no more
<END PAGE>
My heart's true friend;
| the fault is theirs,
The sons of Gjuki, |
for all my grief,
That so their sister |
<END PAGE>
sorely weeps.

20. "So shall your land
| its people lose
As ye have kept | your
oaths of yore;
<END PAGE>
Gunnar, no joy | the
gold shall give thee,
(The rings shall soon |
thy slayers be,)
Who swarest oaths |
<END PAGE>
with Sigurth once.

21. "In the court was
greater | gladness
then
The day my Sigurth |
<END PAGE>
Grani saddled,
And went forth
Brynhild's | hand to win,
That woman ill, | in an
evil hour."

<END PAGE>
22. Then Brynhild
spake, | the daughter
of Buthli:
May the witch now
husband | and children
<END PAGE>
want
Who, Guthrun, loosed |
thy tears at last,
And with magic today |
hath made thee speak.

<END PAGE>
23. Then Gollrond,
daughter | of Gjuki,
spake:
Speak not such words,
| thou hated woman;
Bane of the noble |
<END PAGE>
thou e'er hast been,
(Borne thou art | on
an evil wave,
Sorrow hast brought |
to seven kings,)
And many a woman |
<END PAGE>
hast loveless made.

24. Then Brynhild,
daughter | of Buthli,
spake:
Atli is guilty | of all the
<END PAGE>
sorrow,
(Son of Buthli | and
brother of mine,)
When we saw in the hall
| of the Hunnish race
The flame of the
<END PAGE>
snake's bed | flash
round the hero;
(For the journey
since | full sore have I
paid,
And ever I seek | the
<END PAGE>
sight to forget.)

25. By the pillars she
stood, | and gathered
her strength,
From the eyes of
<END PAGE>
Brynhild, | Buthli's
daughter,
Fire there burned, |
and venom she
breathed,
When the wounds she
<END PAGE>
saw | on Sigurth then.
Guthrun went thence
away to a forest in the
waste, and journeyed
all the way to Denmark,
and was there
<END PAGE>
seven half-years with
Thora, daughter of
Hokon. Brynhild would
not live after Sigurth.
She had eight of
her thralls slain and
