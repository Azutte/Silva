GRIPISSPO
Gripir's Prophecy
<END PAGE>
1. "Who is it has | this
dwelling here,
Or what do men call |
the people's king?"

<END PAGE>
Geitir spake:
Gripir the name | of the
chieftain good
Who holds the folk |
and the firm-ruled
<END PAGE>
land.

Sigurth spake:
2. "Is the king
all-knowing | now within,
Will the monarch come |
<END PAGE>
with me to speak?
A man unknown | his
counsel needs,
And Gripir fain | I soon
would find."

<END PAGE>
Geitir spake:
3. "The ruler glad | of
Geitir will ask
Who seeks with Gripir |
speech to have."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
Sigurth am I, | and
Sigmund's son,
And Hjordis the name |
of the hero's mother.

<END PAGE>
4. Then Geitir went |
and to Gripir spake:
A stranger comes | and
stands without;
Lofty he is | to look
<END PAGE>
upon,
And, prince, thyself |
he fain would see.

5. From the hall the
ruler | of heroes went,
<END PAGE>
And greeted well | the
warrior come:
Sigurth, welcome | long
since had been thine;
Now, Geitir, shalt thou |
<END PAGE>
Grani take.

6. Then of many |
things they talked,
When thus the men | so
wise had met.
<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
To me, if thou knowest, |
my mother's brother,
Say what life | will
Sigurth's be.

<END PAGE>
Gripir spake:
7. "Of men thou shalt
be | on earth the
mightiest,
And higher famed |
<END PAGE>
than all the heroes;
Free of gold-giving, |
slow to flee,
Noble to see, | and
sage in speech."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
8. "Monarch wise, | now
more I ask;
To Sigurth say, | if
thou thinkest to see,
What first will chance |
<END PAGE>
of my fortune fair,
When hence I go | from
out thy home?"

Gripir spake:
9. "First shalt thou,
<END PAGE>
prince, | thy father
avenge,
And Eylimi, | their ills
requiting;
The hardy sons | of
Hunding thou
Soon shalt fell, | and
<END PAGE>
victory find."

Sigurth spake:
10. "Noble king, | my
kinsman, say
Thy meaning true, | for
<END PAGE>
our minds we speak:
For Sigurth mighty |
deeds dost see,
The highest beneath |
the heavens all?"

<END PAGE>
Gripir spake:
IT. "The fiery dragon |
alone thou shalt fight
That greedy lies | at
Gnitaheith;
Thou shalt be of Regin
<END PAGE>
| and Fafnir both
The slayer; truth |
doth Gripir tell thee."

Sigurth spake:
12. "Rich shall I be | if
<END PAGE>
battles I win
With such as these, | as
now thou sayest;
Forward look, | and
further tell:
What the life | that I
<END PAGE>
shall lead?"

Gripir spake:
13. "Fafnir's den | thou
then shalt find,
And all his treasure |
<END PAGE>
fair shalt take;
Gold shalt heap | on
Grani's back,
And, proved in fight, |
to Gjuki fare."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
14. "To the warrior
now | in words. so wise,
Monarch noble, | more
shalt tell;
I am Gjuki's guest, |
<END PAGE>
and thence I go:
What the life | that I
shall lead?"

Gripir spake:
15. "On the rocks
<END PAGE>
there sleeps | the
ruler's daughter,
Fair in armor, | since
Helgi fell;
Thou shalt cut | with
keen-edged sword,
And cleave the byrnie |
<END PAGE>
with Fafnir's killer."

Sigurth spake:
16. "The mail-coat is
broken, | the maiden
speaks,
<END PAGE>
The woman who | from
sleep has wakened;
What says the maid | to
Sigurth then
That happy fate | to
<END PAGE>
the hero brings?"

Gripir spake:
17. "Runes to the
warrior | will she tell,
All that men | may ever
<END PAGE>
seek,
And teach thee to
speak | in all men's
tongues,
And life with health; |
thou'rt happy, king!"
<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
18. "Now is it ended, |
the knowledge is won,
And ready I am | forth
thence to ride;
Forward look | and
<END PAGE>
further tell:
What the life | that I
shall lead?"

Gripir spake:
19. "Then to Heimir's |
<END PAGE>
home thou comest,
And glad shalt be | the
guest of the king;
Ended, Sigurth, | is all I
see,
No further aught | of
<END PAGE>
Gripir ask."

Sigurth spake:
20. "Sorrow brings me |
the word thou sayest,
For, monarch, forward
<END PAGE>
| further thou seest;
Sad the grief | for
Sigurth thou knowest,
Yet nought to me,
Gripir, | known wilt
make."
<END PAGE>
Gripir spake:
21. "Before me lay | in
clearest light
All of thy youth | for
mine eyes to see;
Not rightly can I | wise
<END PAGE>
be called,
Nor forward-seeing; |
my wisdom is fled."

Sigurth spake:
22. "No man, Gripir, | on
<END PAGE>
earth I know
Who sees the future |
as far as thou;
Hide thou nought, |
though hard it be,
And base the deeds |
<END PAGE>
that I shall do."

Gripir spake:
2Z. "With baseness
never | thy life is
burdened,
<END PAGE>
Hero noble, | hold that
sure;
Lofty as long | as the
world shall live,
Battle-bringer, | thy
<END PAGE>
name shall be."

Sigurth spake:
24. "Nought could seem
worse, | but now must
part
<END PAGE>
The prince and Sigurth,
| since so it is,
My road I ask,-- | the
future lies open,--
Mighty one, speak, | my
<END PAGE>
mother's brother."

Gripir spake:
25. "Now to Sigurth | all
shall I say,
For to this the warrior
<END PAGE>
| bends my will;
Thou knowest well |
that I will not lie,--
A day there is | when
thy death is doomed."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
26. "No scorn I know |
for the noble king,
But counsel good |
from Gripir I seek;
Well will I know, | though
<END PAGE>
evil awaits,
What Sigurth may |
before him see."

Gripir spake:
27. "A maid in Heimir's |
<END PAGE>
home there dwells,
Brynhild her name | to
men is known,
Daughter of Buthli, |
the doughty king,
And Heimir fosters |
<END PAGE>
the fearless maid."

Sigurth spake:
28. "What is it to me, |
though the maiden be
So fair, and of Heimir |
<END PAGE>
the fosterling is?
Gripir, truth | to me
shalt tell,
For all of fate |
before me thou seest."

<END PAGE>
Gripir spake:
29. "Of many a joy |
the maiden robs thee,
Fair to see, | whom
Heimir fosters;
Sleep thou shalt find
<END PAGE>
not, | feuds thou shalt
end not,
Nor seek out men, | if
the maid thou seest
not."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
30. "What may be had |
for Sigurth's healing?
Say now, Gripir, | if see
thou canst;
May I buy the maid |
<END PAGE>
with the
marriage-price,
The daughter fair | of
the chieftain famed?"

Gripir spake:
31. "Ye twain shall all |
<END PAGE>
the oaths then swear
That bind full fast; |
few shall ye keep;
One night when Gjuki's |
guest thou hast been,
Will Heimir's fosterling |
<END PAGE>
fade from thy mind."

Sigurth spake:
32. "What sayst thou,
Gripir? | give me the
truth,
<END PAGE>
Does fickleness hide |
in the hero's heart?
Can it be that troth | I
break with the maid,
With her I believed | I
<END PAGE>
loved so dear?"

Gripir spake:
33. "Tricked by
another, | prince, thou
art,
<END PAGE>
And the price of
Grimhild's | wiles thou
must pay;
Fain of thee | for the
fair-haired maid,
Her daughter, she is, |
<END PAGE>
and she drags thee
down."

Sigurth spake:
34. "Might I with Gunnar
| kinship make,
And Guthrun win | to be
<END PAGE>
my wife,
Well the hero | wedded
would be,
If my treacherous
deed | would trouble me
not."
<END PAGE>
Gripir spake:
35. "Wholly Grimhild |
thy heart deceives,
She will bid thee go |
and Brynhild woo
For Gunnar's wife, | the
<END PAGE>
lord of the Goths;
And the prince's
mother | thy promise
shall win."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
36. "Evil waits me, | well
I see it,
And gone is Sigurth's |
wisdom good,
If I shall woo | for
<END PAGE>
another to win
The maiden fair | that
so fondly I loved."

Gripir spake:
37. "Ye three shall | all
<END PAGE>
the oaths then take,
Gunnar and Hogni, |
and, hero, thou;
Your forms ye shall
change, | as forth ye
tare,
<END PAGE>
Gunnar and thou; | for
Gripir lies not."

Sigurth spake:
38. "How meanest thou?
<END PAGE>
| Why make we the
change
Of shape and form | as
forth we fare?
There must follow |
another falsehood
Grim in all ways; | speak
<END PAGE>
on, Gripir!"

Gripir spake:
39. "The form of
Gunnar | and shape
thou gettest,
<END PAGE>
But mind and voice |
thine own remain;
The hand of the
fosterling | noble of
Heimir
Now dost thou win, | and
<END PAGE>
none can prevent."

Sigurth spake:
40. "Most evil it seems, |
and men will say
Base is Sigurth | that
<END PAGE>
so he did;
Not of my will shall | I
cheat with wiles
The heroes' maiden |
whom noblest I hold."

<END PAGE>
Gripir spake:
41. "Thou dwellest,
leader | lofty of men,
With the maid as if | thy
mother she were;
Lofty as long | as the
<END PAGE>
world shall live,
Ruler of men, | thy
name shall remain."

Sigurth spake:
42. "Shall Gunnar have
<END PAGE>
| a goodly wife,
Famed among men,-- |
speak forth now, Gripir!
Although at my side |
three nights she slept,
The warrior's bride? |
<END PAGE>
Such ne'er has been."

Gripir spake:
43. "The marriage
draught | will be drunk
for both,
<END PAGE>
For Sigurth and
Gunnar, | in Gjuki's hall;
Your forms ye change,
| when home ye fare,
But the mind of each |
<END PAGE>
to himself remains."

Sigurth spake:
44. "Shall the kinship
new | thereafter come
To good among us? |
<END PAGE>
Tell me, Gripir!
To Gunnar joy | shall it
later give,
Or happiness send |
for me myself?"

<END PAGE>
Gripir spake:
45. "Thine oaths
remembering, | silent
thou art,
And dwellest with
<END PAGE>
Guthrun | in wedlock
good;
But Brynhild shall deem
| she is badly mated,
And wiles she seeks, |
herself to avenge."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
46. "What may for the
bride | requital be,
The wife we won | with
subtle wiles?
From me she has | the
<END PAGE>
oaths I made,
And kept not long; |
they gladdened her
little."

<END PAGE>
Gripir spake:
47. "To Gunnar soon |
his bride will say
That ill didst thou |
thine oath fulfill,
When the goodly king, |
<END PAGE>
the son of Gjuki,
With all his heart | the
hero trusted."

Sigurth spake:
48. "What sayst thou,
<END PAGE>
Gripir? | give me the
truth!
Am I guilty so | as now
is said,
Or lies does the
far-famed | queen put
<END PAGE>
forth
Of me and herself? |
Yet further speak."

Gripir spake:
49. "In wrath and grief
<END PAGE>
| full little good
The noble bride | shall
work thee now;
No shame thou gavest |
the goodly one,
Though the monarch's
<END PAGE>
wife | with wiles didst
cheat."

Sigurth spake:
50. "Shall Gunnar the
wise | to the woman's
<END PAGE>
words,
And Gotthorm and
Hogni, | then give heed?
Shall Gjuki's sons, |
now tell me, Gripir,
Redden their blades |
<END PAGE>
with their kinsman's
blood?"

Gripir spake:
51. "Heavy it lies | on
Guthrun's heart,
When her brothers all |
<END PAGE>
shall bring thee death;
Never again | shall she
happiness know,
The woman so fair; | 'tis
Grimhild's work."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
52. "Now fare thee well!
| our fates we shun
not;
And well has Gripir |
<END PAGE>
answered my wish;
More of joy | to me
wouldst tell
Of my life to come | if
so thou couldst."

<END PAGE>
Gripir spake:
53 "Ever remember,
ruler of men,
That fortune lies in the
hero's life;
A nobler man shall
<END PAGE>
