SVIPDAGSMOL
The Ballad of Svipdag
<END PAGE>
1. "Wake thee, Groa! |
wake, mother good!
At the doors of the
dead I call thee;
Thy son, bethink thee, |
<END PAGE>
thou badst to seek
Thy help at the hill of
death."

Groa spake:
2. "What evil vexes |
<END PAGE>
mine only son,
What baleful fate hast
thou found,
That thou callest thy
mother, | who lies in the
mould,
<END PAGE>
And the world of the
living has left?"

Svipdag spake:
3. "The woman false |
<END PAGE>
whom my father
embraced
Has brought me a
baleful game;
For she bade me go
forth | where none may
<END PAGE>
fare,
And Mengloth the maid
to seek."

Groa spake:
4. "Long is the way, |
<END PAGE>
long must thou wander,
But long is love as well;
Thou mayst find,
perchance, | what thou
fain wouldst have,
If the fates their
<END PAGE>
favor will give."

Svipdag spake:
5. "Charms full good |
then chant to me,
mother,
<END PAGE>
And seek thy son to
guard;
For death do I fear |
on the way I shall
fare,
And in years am I
<END PAGE>
young, methinks."

Groa spake:
6. "Then first I will
chant thee | the charm
oft-tried,
<END PAGE>
That Rani taught to
Rind;
From the shoulder
whate'er | mislikes thee
shake,
For helper thyself
<END PAGE>
shalt thou have.

7. "Then next I will
chant thee, | if needs
thou must travel,
And wander a
<END PAGE>
purposeless way:
The bolts of Urth |
shall on every side
Be thy guards on the
road thou goest.

<END PAGE>
8. "Then third I will
chant thee, | if
threatening streams
The danger of death
shall bring:
Yet to Hel shall turn |
<END PAGE>
both Horn and Ruth,
And before thee the
waters shall fail.

9. "Then fourth I will
<END PAGE>
chant thee, | if come
thy foes
On the gallows-way
against thee:
Into thine hands | shall
their hearts be given,
And peace shall the
<END PAGE>
warriors wish.

10. "Then fifth I will
chant thee, | if fetters
perchance
Shall bind thy bending
<END PAGE>
limbs:
O'er thy thighs do I
chant | a
loosening-charm,
And the lock is burst
from the limbs,
<END PAGE>
And the fetters fall
from the feet.

11. "Then sixth I will
chant thee, | if storms
<END PAGE>
on the sea
Have might unknown to
man:
Yet never shall wind |
or wave do harm,
And calm is the course
<END PAGE>
of thy boat.

12. "Then seventh I
chant thee, | if frost
shall seek
To kill thee on lofty
<END PAGE>
crags:
The fatal cold | shall
not grip thy flesh,
And whole thy body
shall be.

<END PAGE>
13. "Then eighth will I
chant thee, | if ever by
night
Thou shalt wander on
murky ways:
Yet never the curse |
<END PAGE>
of a Christian woman
From the dead shall do
thee harm.

14. "Then ninth will I
<END PAGE>
chant thee, | if needs
thou must strive
With a warlike giant in
words:
Thy heart good store |
of wit shall have,
And thy mouth of
<END PAGE>
words full wise.

15. "Now fare on the
way | where danger
waits,
Let evils not lessen
<END PAGE>
thy love!
I have stood at the
door | of the
earth-fixed stones,
The while I chanted
thee charms.
<END PAGE>
16. "Bear hence, my
son, | what thy mother
hath said,
And let it live in thy
breast;
Thine ever shall be the
<END PAGE>
| best of fortune,
So long as my words
shall last."
II. FJOLMINNSMOL
THE LAY OF FJOLSVITH

<END PAGE>
17. Before the house |
he beheld one coming
To the home of the
giants high.

<END PAGE>
Svipdag spake:
What giant is here, | in
front of the house,
And around him fires
are flaming?

<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith spake:
3. "What seekest thou
here? | for what is thy
search?
What, friendless one,
<END PAGE>
fain wouldst thou
know?
By the ways so wet |
must thou wander
hence,
For, weakling, no home
<END PAGE>
hast thou here."

Svipdag spake:
19. "What giant is here,
| in front of the house,
To the wayfarer
<END PAGE>
welcome denying?"

Fjolsvith spake:
Greeting full fair | thou
never shalt find,
So hence shalt thou
<END PAGE>
get thee home.

20. Fjolsvith am I, | and
wise am I found,
But miserly am I with
meat;
<END PAGE>
Thou never shalt
enter | within the
house,--
Go forth like a wolf on
thy way!"

<END PAGE>
Svipdag spake:
21. "Few from the joy |
of their eyes will go
forth,
When the sight of their
<END PAGE>
loves they seek;
Full bright are the
gates | of the golden
hall,
And a home shall I
here enjoy."
<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith spake:
22. "Tell me now, fellow,
| what father thou
hast,
And the kindred of
<END PAGE>
whom thou camst."

Svipdag spake:
Vindkald am I, | and
Varkald's son,
And Fjolkald his father
<END PAGE>
was.

23. Now answer me,
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
<END PAGE>
would I know:
Who is it that holds |
and has for his own
The rule of the hall so
rich?"

<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith spake:
224. "Mengloth is she, |
her mother bore her
To the son of
Svafrthorin;
She is it that holds |
<END PAGE>
and has for her own
The rule of the hall so
rich."

Svipdag spake:
25. "Now answer me,
<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
would I know:
What call they the
gate? | for among the
<END PAGE>
gods
Ne'er saw man so grim
a sight."

Fjolsvith spake:
26. "Thrymgjol they
<END PAGE>
call it; | 'twas made by
the three,
The sons of Solblindi;
And fast as a fetter |
the farer it holds,
Whoever shall lift the
<END PAGE>
latch."

Svipdag spake:
27. "Now answer me,
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
<END PAGE>
For now the truth
would I know:
What call they the
house? | for no man
beheld
Mongst the gods so
<END PAGE>
grim a sight."

Fjolsvith spake:
28. "Gastropnir is it, |
of old I made it
From the limbs of
<END PAGE>
Leirbrimir;
I braced it so strongly
| that fast it shall
stand
So long as the world
shall last."
<END PAGE>
Svipdag spake:
29. "Now answer me,
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
<END PAGE>
would I know:
What call they the tree
| that casts abroad
Its limbs o'er every
land?"

<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith spake:
30. "Mimameith its name,
| and no man knows
What root beneath it
runs;
And few can guess |
<END PAGE>
what shall fell the
tree,
For fire nor iron shall
fell it."

Svipdag spake:
31. "Now answer me,
<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
would I know:
What grows from the
seed | of the tree so
<END PAGE>
great,
That fire nor iron
shall fell?"

Fjolsvith spake:
32. "Women, sick | with
<END PAGE>
child, shall seek
Its fruit to the flames
to bear;
Then out shall come |
what within was hid,
And so is it mighty with
<END PAGE>
men."

Svipdag spake:
33. "Now answer me,
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
<END PAGE>
For now the truth
would I know:
What cock is he | on
the highest bough,
That glitters all with
<END PAGE>
gold?"

Fjolsvith spake:
34. "Vithofnir his name,
| and now he shines
Like lightning on
<END PAGE>
Mimameith's limbs;
And great is the
trouble | with which he
grieves
Both Surt and
Sinmora."
<END PAGE>
Svipdag spake:
35. "Now answer me,
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
<END PAGE>
would I know:
What call they the
hounds, | that before
the house
So fierce and angry
are?"
<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith spake:
36. "Gif call they one, |
and Geri the other,
If now the truth thou
wouldst know;
Great they are, | and
<END PAGE>
their might will grow,
Till the gods to death
are doomed."

Svipdag spake:
37. "Now answer me,
<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
would I know:
May no man hope | the
house to enter,
While the hungry
<END PAGE>
hounds are sleeping?"

Fjolsvith spake:
38. "Together they
sleep not, | for so was
it fixed
<END PAGE>
When the guard to them
was given;
One sleeps by night, |
the next by day,
So no man may enter
<END PAGE>
ever."

Svipdag spake:
39, "Now answer me,
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
<END PAGE>
For now the truth
would I know:
Is there no meat | that
men may give them,
And leap within while
<END PAGE>
they eat?"

Fjolsvith spake:
40. "Two wing-joints
there be | in Vithofnir's
body,
<END PAGE>
If now the truth thou
wouldst know;
That alone is the meat |
that men may give them,
And leap within while
<END PAGE>
they eat."

Svipdag spake:
41. "Now answer me,
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
<END PAGE>
For now the truth
would I know:
What weapon can send |
Vithofnir to seek
The house of Hel
<END PAGE>
below?"

Fjolsvith spake:
42. "Lævatein is there, |
that Lopt with runes
Once made by the
<END PAGE>
doors of death;
In Lægjarn's chest | by
Sinmora lies it,
And nine locks fasten
it firm."

<END PAGE>
Svipdag spake:
43. "Now answer me,
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
<END PAGE>
would I know:
May a man come thence,
| who thither goes,
And tries the sword to
take?"

<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith spake:
44. "Thence may he
come | who thither
goes,
And tries the sword to
<END PAGE>
take,
If with him he carries |
what few can win,
To give to the goddess
of gold."

<END PAGE>
Svipdag spake:
45. "Now answer me,
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
<END PAGE>
would I know:
What treasure is there
| that men may take
To rejoice the
giantess pale?"

<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith spake:
46. "The sickle bright |
in thy wallet bear,
Mid Vithofnir's
feathers found;
To Sinmora give it, | and
<END PAGE>
then shall she grant
That the weapon by
thee be won."

Svipdag spake:
47. "Now answer me,
<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
would I know:
What call they the hall,
| encompassed here
With flickering magic
<END PAGE>
flames?"

Fjolsvith spake:
48. "Lyr is it called, |
and long it shall
On the tip of a
<END PAGE>
spear-point tremble;
Of the noble house |
mankind has heard,
But more has it never
known."

<END PAGE>
Svipdag spake:
49. "Now answer me,
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
<END PAGE>
would I know:
What one of the gods |
has made so great
The hall I behold
within?"

<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith spake:
50. "Uni and Iri, | Bari
and Jari,
Var and Vegdrasil,
Dori and Ori, | Delling,
<END PAGE>
and there
Was Loki, the fear of
the folk."

Svipdag spake:
51. "Now answer me,
<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
would I know:
What call they the
mountain | on which the
<END PAGE>
maid
Is lying so lovely to
see?"

Fjolsvith spake:
52. "Lyfjaberg is it, |
<END PAGE>
and long shall it be
A joy to the sick and
the sore;
For well shall grow |
each woman who climbs
it,
<END PAGE>
Though sick full long
she has lain."

Svipdag spake:
53. "Now answer me,
<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
would I know:
What maidens are they |
that at Mengloth's
<END PAGE>
knees
Are sitting so gladly
together?"

Fjolsvith spake:
54. "Hlif is one named, |
<END PAGE>
Hlifthrasa another,
Thjothvara call they
the third;
Bjort and Bleik, | Blith
and Frith,
Eir and Aurbotha."
<END PAGE>
Svipdag spake:
55. "Now answer me,
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
<END PAGE>
would I know:
Aid bring they to all |
who offerings give,
If need be found
therefor?"

<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith spake:
56. "Soon aid they all |
who offerings give
On the holy altars high;
And if danger they see
<END PAGE>
| for the sons of men,
Then each from ill do
they guard."

Svipdag spake:
57. "Now answer me,
<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith, | the
question I ask,
For now the truth
would I know:
Lives there the man |
who in Mengloth's arms
So fair may seek to
<END PAGE>
sleep?"

Fjolsvith spake:
58. "No man there is |
who in Mengloth's arms
So fair may seek to
<END PAGE>
sleep,
Save Svipdag alone, |
for the sun-bright
maid
Is destined his bride to
be."
<END PAGE>
Svipdag spake:
59. "Fling back the
gates! | make the
gateway wide!
Here mayst thou
<END PAGE>
Svipdag see!
Hence get thee to find
| if gladness soon
Mengloth to me will
give."

<END PAGE>
Fjolsvith spake:
60. "Hearken, Mengloth,
| a man is come;
Go thou the guest to
see!
The hounds are
<END PAGE>
fawning, | the house
bursts open,--
Svipdag, methinks, is
there."

Mengloth spake:
61. "On the gallows
<END PAGE>
high | shall hungry
ravens
Soon thine eyes pluck
out,
If thou liest in saying |
that here at last
The hero is come to my
<END PAGE>
hall.

62. "Whence camest
thou hither? | how
camest thou here?
What name do thy
<END PAGE>
kinsmen call thee?
Thy race and thy name
| as a sign must I know,
That thy bride I am
destined to be."

<END PAGE>
Svipdag spake:
63. "Svipdag am I, | and
Solbjart's son;
Thence came I by
wind-cold ways;
With the words of Urth
<END PAGE>
| shall no man war,
Though unearned her
gifts be given."

Mengloth spake:
64. "Welcome thou art, |
<END PAGE>
for long have I waited;
The welcoming kiss
shalt thou win!
For two who love | is
the longed-for meeting
The greatest gladness
<END PAGE>
of all.

65. "Long have I sat |
on Lyfjaberg here,
Awaiting thee day by
day;
<END PAGE>
And now I have | what I
ever hoped,
For here thou art
come to my hall.

<END PAGE>
66. "Alike we yearned; |
I longed for thee,
And thou for my love
hast longed;
But now henceforth |
<END PAGE>
