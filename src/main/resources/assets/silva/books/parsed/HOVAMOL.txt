HOVAMOL
The Ballad of the High One
<END PAGE>
1. Within the gates | ere
a man shall go,
(Full warily let him
watch,)
Full long let him look
<END PAGE>
about him;
For little he knows |
where a foe may lurk,
And sit in the seats
within.

<END PAGE>
2. Hail to the giver! | a
guest has come;
Where shall the
stranger sit?
Swift shall he be who, |
<END PAGE>
with swords shall try
The proof of his might
to make.

3. Fire he needs | who
with frozen knees
<END PAGE>
Has come from the cold
without;
Food and clothes |
must the farer have,
The man from the
<END PAGE>
mountains come.

4. Water and towels |
and welcoming speech
Should he find who
comes, to the feast;
<END PAGE>
If renown he would get,
| and again be greeted,
Wisely and well must he
act.

<END PAGE>
5. Wits must he have |
who wanders wide,
But all is easy at home;
At the witless man | the
wise shall wink
When among such men
<END PAGE>
he sits.

6. A man shall not
boast | of his keenness
of mind,
But keep it close in his
<END PAGE>
breast;
To the silent and wise |
does ill come seldom
When he goes as guest
to a house;
(For a faster friend |
<END PAGE>
one never finds
Than wisdom tried and
true.)

7. The knowing guest |
who goes to the feast,
<END PAGE>
In silent attention sits;
With his ears he hears,
| with his eyes he
watches,
Thus wary are wise
<END PAGE>
men all.

8. Happy the one | who
wins for himself
Favor and praises
fair;
<END PAGE>
Less safe by far | is
the wisdom found
That is hid in another's
heart.

<END PAGE>
9. Happy the man | who
has while he lives
Wisdom and praise as
well,
For evil counsel | a
<END PAGE>
man full oft
Has from another's
heart.

10. A better burden |
may no man bear
<END PAGE>
For wanderings wide
than wisdom;
It is better than wealth
| on unknown ways,
And in grief a refuge it
<END PAGE>
gives.

11. A better burden |
may no man bear
For wanderings wide
than wisdom;
<END PAGE>
Worse food for the
journey | he brings
not afield
Than an over-drinking
of ale.

<END PAGE>
12. Less good there
lies | than most believe
In ale for mortal men;
For the more he drinks
| the less does man
Of his mind the mastery
<END PAGE>
hold.

13. Over beer the bird
| of forgetfulness
broods,
And steals the minds of
<END PAGE>
men;
With the heron's
feathers | fettered I
lay
And in Gunnloth's
house was held.
<END PAGE>
14. Drunk I was, | I was
dead-drunk,
When with Fjalar wise I
was;
Tis the best of drinking
<END PAGE>
| if back one brings
His wisdom with him
home.

15. The son of a king |
<END PAGE>
shall be silent and
wise,
And bold in battle as
well;
Bravely and gladly | a
man shall go,
Till the day of his
<END PAGE>
death is come.

16. The sluggard
believes | he shall live
forever,
If the fight he faces
<END PAGE>
not;
But age shall not grant
him | the gift of peace,
Though spears may
spare his life.

<END PAGE>
17. The fool is agape |
when he comes to the
feast,
He stammers or else is
still;
But soon if he gets | a
<END PAGE>
drink is it seen
What the mind of the
man is like.

18. He alone is aware |
who has wandered wide,
<END PAGE>
And far abroad has
fared,
How great a mind | is
guided by him
That wealth of wisdom
<END PAGE>
has.

19. Shun not the mead, |
but drink in measure;
Speak to the point or
be still;
<END PAGE>
For rudeness none |
shall rightly blame thee
If soon thy bed thou
seekest.

<END PAGE>
20. The greedy man, | if
his mind be vague,
Will eat till sick he is;
The vulgar man, | when
among the wise,
To scorn by his belly
<END PAGE>
is brought.

21. The herds know
well | when home they
shall fare,
And then from the
<END PAGE>
grass they go;
But the foolish man |
his belly's measure
Shall never know
aright.

<END PAGE>
22. A paltry man | and
poor of mind
At all things ever
mocks;
For never he knows, |
<END PAGE>
what he ought to know,
That he is not free
from faults.

23. The witless man | is
awake all night,
<END PAGE>
Thinking of many things;
Care-worn he is | when
the morning comes,
And his woe is just as
it was.

<END PAGE>
24. The foolish man |
for friends all those
Who laugh at him will
hold;
When among the wise |
<END PAGE>
he marks it not
Though hatred of him
they speak.

25. The foolish man |
for friends all those
<END PAGE>
Who laugh at him will
hold;
But the truth when he
comes | to the council
he learns,
That few in his favor
<END PAGE>
will speak.

26. An ignorant man |
thinks that all he
knows,
When he sits by himself
<END PAGE>
in a corner;
But never what answer
| to make he knows,
When others with
questions come.

<END PAGE>
27. A witless man, |
when he meets with men,
Had best in silence
abide;
For no one shall find |
<END PAGE>
that nothing he knows,
If his mouth is not
open too much.
(But a man knows not, |
if nothing he knows,
When his mouth has
<END PAGE>
been open too much.)

28. Wise shall he seem |
who well can question,
And also answer well;
Nought is concealed |
<END PAGE>
that men may say
Among the sons of men.

29. Often he speaks |
who never is still
With words that win no
<END PAGE>
faith;
The babbling tongue, |
if a bridle it find not,
Oft for itself sings ill.

<END PAGE>
30. In mockery no one |
a man shall hold,
Although he fare to
the feast;
Wise seems one oft, | if
<END PAGE>
nought he is asked,
And safely he sits
dry-skinned.

31. Wise a guest holds
it | to take to his heels,
<END PAGE>
When mock of another
he makes;
But little he knows |
who laughs at the
feast,
Though he mocks in the
<END PAGE>
midst of his foes.

32. Friendly of mind |
are many men,
Till feasting they mock
at their friends;
<END PAGE>
To mankind a bane |
must it ever be
When guests together
strive.

<END PAGE>
33. Oft should one
make | an early meal,
Nor fasting come to
the feast;
Else he sits and chews
<END PAGE>
| as if he would choke,
And little is able to ask.

34. Crooked and far |
is the road to a foe,
Though his house on
<END PAGE>
the highway be;
But wide and straight |
is the way to a friend,
Though far away he
fare.

<END PAGE>
35. Forth shall one go,
| nor stay as a guest
In a single spot
forever;
Love becomes loathing
<END PAGE>
| if long one sits
By the hearth in
another's home.

36. Better a house, |
though a hut it be,
<END PAGE>
A man is master at
home;
A pair of goats | and a
patched-up roof
Are better far than
<END PAGE>
begging.

37. Better a house, |
though a hut it be,
A man is master at
home;
<END PAGE>
His heart is bleeding |
who needs must beg
When food he fain
would have.

<END PAGE>
38. Away from his arms
| in the open field
A man should fare not
a foot;
For never he knows |
<END PAGE>
when the need for a
spear
Shall arise on the
distant road.

39. If wealth a man |
<END PAGE>
has won for himself,
Let him never suffer in
need;
Oft he saves for a foe
| what he plans for a
friend,
<END PAGE>
For much goes worse
than we wish.

40. None so free with
gifts | or food have I
<END PAGE>
found
That gladly he took not
a gift,
Nor one who so widely |
scattered his wealth
That of recompense
<END PAGE>
hatred he had.

41. Friends shall
gladden each other |
with arms and
garments,
<END PAGE>
As each for himself
can see;
Gift-givers'
friendships | are
longest found,
If fair their fates may
<END PAGE>
be.

42. To his friend a man
| a friend shall prove,
And gifts with gifts
requite;
<END PAGE>
But men shall mocking |
with mockery answer,
And fraud with
falsehood meet.

<END PAGE>
43. To his friend a man
| a friend shall prove,
To him and the friend
of his friend;
But never a man | shall
<END PAGE>
friendship make
With one of his
foeman's friends.

44. If a friend thou
<END PAGE>
hast | whom thou fully
wilt trust,
And good from him
wouldst get,
Thy thoughts with his
mingle, | and gifts shalt
<END PAGE>
thou make,
And fare to find him
oft.

45. If another thou
<END PAGE>
hast | whom thou
hardly wilt trust,
Yet good from him
wouldst get,
Thou shalt speak him
fair, | but falsely think,
And fraud with
<END PAGE>
falsehood requite.

46. So is it with him |
whom thou hardly wilt
trust,
And whose mind thou
<END PAGE>
mayst not know;
Laugh with him mayst
thou, | but speak not
thy mind,
Like gifts to his shalt
thou give.
<END PAGE>
47. Young was I once, |
and wandered alone,
And nought of the
road I knew;
Rich did I feel | when a
<END PAGE>
comrade I found,
For man is man's
delight.

48. The lives of the
<END PAGE>
brave | and noble are
best,
Sorrows they seldom
feed;
But the coward fear |
of all things feels,
And not gladly the
<END PAGE>
niggard gives.

49. My garments once |
in a field I gave
To a pair of carven
poles;
<END PAGE>
Heroes they seemed |
when clothes they had,
But the naked man is
nought.

<END PAGE>
50. On the hillside
drear | the fir-tree
dies,
All bootless its needles
and bark;
It is like a man | whom
<END PAGE>
no one loves,--
Why should his life be
long?

51. Hotter than fire |
between false friends
<END PAGE>
Does friendship five
days burn;
When the sixth day
comes | the fire cools,
And ended is all the
<END PAGE>
love.

52. No great thing
needs | a man to give,
Oft little will purchase
praise;
<END PAGE>
With half a loaf | and a
half-filled cup
A friend full fast I
made.

<END PAGE>
53. A little sand | has a
little sea,
And small are the minds
of men;
Though all men are not
<END PAGE>
| equal in wisdom,
Yet half-wise only are
all.

54. A measure of
<END PAGE>
wisdom | each man shall
have,
But never too much let
him know;
The fairest lives | do
those men live
Whose wisdom wide has
<END PAGE>
grown.

55. A measure of
wisdom | each man shall
have,
But never too much let
<END PAGE>
him know;
For the wise man's
heart | is seldom
happy,
If wisdom too great he
has won.
<END PAGE>
56. A measure of
wisdom | each man shall
have,
But never too much let
him know;
Let no man the fate |
<END PAGE>
before him see,
For so is he freest
from sorrow.

57. A brand from a
<END PAGE>
brand | is kindled and
burned,
And fire from fire
begotten;
And man by his speech
| is known to men,
And the stupid by their
<END PAGE>
stillness.

58. He must early go
forth | who fain the
blood
Or the goods of
<END PAGE>
another would get;
The wolf that lies idle |
shall win little meat,
Or the sleeping man
success.

<END PAGE>
59. He must early go
forth | whose workers
are few,
Himself his work to
seek;
Much remains undone |
<END PAGE>
for the
morning-sleeper,
For the swift is wealth
half won.

60. Of seasoned
<END PAGE>
shingles | and strips of
bark
For the thatch let one
know his need,
And how much of wood |
he must have for a
<END PAGE>
month,
Or in half a year he
will use.

61. Washed and fed | to
the council fare,
<END PAGE>
But care not too much
for thy clothes;
Let none be ashamed |
of his shoes and hose,
Less still of the steed
<END PAGE>
he rides,
(Though poor be the
horse he has.)

62. When the eagle
<END PAGE>
comes | to the ancient
sea,
He snaps and hangs
his head;
So is a man | in the
midst of a throng,
Who few to speak for
<END PAGE>
him finds.

63. To question and
answer | must all be
ready
Who wish to be known
<END PAGE>
as wise;
Tell one thy thoughts, |
but beware of two,--
All know what is known
to three.

<END PAGE>
64. The man who is
prudent | a measured
use
Of the might he has will
make;
He finds when among |
<END PAGE>
the brave he fares
That the boldest he
may not be.

65. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
<END PAGE>
Oft for the words |
that to others one
speaks
He will get but an evil
gift.

<END PAGE>
66. Too early to many |
a meeting I came,
And some too late have
I sought;
The beer was all
<END PAGE>
drunk, | or not yet
brewed;
Little the loathed man
finds.

67. To their homes men
<END PAGE>
would bid | me hither
and yon,
If at meal-time I
needed no meat,
Or would hang two
hams | in my true
<END PAGE>
friend's house,
Where only one I had
eaten.

68. Fire for men | is
the fairest gift,
<END PAGE>
And power to see the
sun;
Health as well, | if a
man may have it,
And a life not stained
<END PAGE>
with sin.

69. All wretched is no
man, | though never so
sick;
Some from their sons
<END PAGE>
have joy,
Some win it from
kinsmen, | and some
from their wealth,
And some from worthy
works.
<END PAGE>
70. It is better to live |
than to lie a corpse,
The live man catches
the cow;
I saw flames rise | for
<END PAGE>
the rich man's pyre,
And before his door
he lay dead.

71. The lame rides a
<END PAGE>
horse, | the handless
is herdsman,
The deaf in battle is
bold;
The blind man is better
| than one that is
<END PAGE>
burned,
No good can come of a
corpse.

72. A son is better, |
<END PAGE>
though late he be
born,
And his father to
death have fared;
Memory-stones |
seldom stand by the
<END PAGE>
road
Save when kinsman
honors his kin.

73. Two make a battle, |
<END PAGE>
the tongue slays the
head;
In each furry coat | a
fist I look for.

74. He welcomes the
<END PAGE>
night | whose fare is
enough,
(Short are the yards
of a ship,)
Uneasy are autumn
nights;
Full oft does the
<END PAGE>
weather | change in a
week,
And more in a month's
time.

75. A man knows not, | if
<END PAGE>
nothing he knows,
That gold oft apes
begets;
One man is wealthy |
and one is poor,
Yet scorn for him none
<END PAGE>
should know.

76. Among Fitjung's
sons | saw I
well-stocked folds,--
Now bear they the
<END PAGE>
beggar's staff;
Wealth is as swift | as a
winking eye,
Of friends the falsest
it is.

<END PAGE>
77. Cattle die, | and
kinsmen die,
And so one dies one's
self;
But a noble name | will
<END PAGE>
never die,
If good renown one
gets.

78. Cattle die, | and
kinsmen die,
<END PAGE>
And so one dies one's
self;
One thing now | that
never dies,
The fame of a dead
<END PAGE>
man's deeds.

79. Certain is that |
which is sought from
runes,
That the gods so great
<END PAGE>
have made,
And the Master-Poet
painted;
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . of the race of
gods:
<END PAGE>
Silence is safest and
best.

80. An unwise man, | if a
maiden's love
Or wealth he chances
<END PAGE>
to win,
His pride will wax, but
his wisdom never,
Straight forward he
fares in conceit.
* * *
<END PAGE>
81. Give praise to the
day at evening, | to a
woman on her pyre,
To a weapon which is
tried, | to a maid at wed
<END PAGE>
lock,
To ice when it is
crossed, | to ale that
is drunk.

<END PAGE>
82. When the gale blows
hew wood, | in fair
winds seek the water;
Sport with maidens at
dusk, | for day's eyes
<END PAGE>
are many;
From the ship seek
swiftness, | from the
shield protection,
Cuts from the sword, |
from the maiden kisses.
<END PAGE>
83. By the fire drink
ale, | over ice go on
skates;
Buy a steed that is
lean, | and a sword
<END PAGE>
when tarnished,
The horse at home
fatten, | the hound in
thy dwelling.
* * *

<END PAGE>
84. A man shall trust
not | the oath of a
maid,
Nor the word a woman
speaks;
For their hearts on a
<END PAGE>
whirling | wheel were
fashioned,
And fickle their
breasts were formed.

85. In a breaking bow |
<END PAGE>
or a burning flame,
A ravening wolf | or a
croaking raven,
In a grunting boar, | a
tree with roots broken,
In billowy seas | or a
<END PAGE>
bubbling kettle,

86. In a flying arrow |
or falling waters,
In ice new formed | or
the serpent's folds,
<END PAGE>
In a bride's
bed-speech | or a
broken sword,
In the sport of bears |
or in sons of kings,

<END PAGE>
87. In a calf that is
sick | or a stubborn
thrall,
A flattering witch | or a
foe new slain.

<END PAGE>
88. In a brother's
slayer, | if thou meet
him abroad,
In a half-burned
house, | in a horse full
<END PAGE>
swift--
One leg is hurt | and
the horse is useless--
None had ever such
faith | as to trust in
them all.
<END PAGE>
89. Hope not too
surely | for early
harvest,
Nor trust too soon in
thy son;
The field needs good
<END PAGE>
weather, | the son
needs wisdom,
And oft is either
denied.
* * *

<END PAGE>
90. The love of women |
fickle of will
Is like starting o'er ice
| with a steed unshod,
A two-year-old restive
<END PAGE>
| and little tamed,
Or steering a
rudderless | ship in a
storm,
Or, lame, hunting
<END PAGE>
reindeer | on slippery
rocks.
* * *

91. Clear now will I
speak, | for I know
<END PAGE>
them both,
Men false to women are
found;
When fairest we speak,
| then falsest we think,
Against wisdom we work
<END PAGE>
with deceit.

92. Soft words shall he
speak | and wealth
shall he offer
Who longs for a
<END PAGE>
maiden's love,
And the beauty praise |
of the maiden bright;
He wins whose wooing is
best.

<END PAGE>
93. Fault for loving |
let no man find
Ever with any other;
Oft the wise are
fettered, | where fools
<END PAGE>
go free,
By beauty that breeds
desire.

94. Fault with another |
let no man find
<END PAGE>
For what touches many
a man;
Wise men oft | into
witless fools
Are made by mighty
<END PAGE>
love.

95. The head alone
knows | what dwells
near the heart,
A man knows his mind
<END PAGE>
alone;
No sickness is worse |
to one who is wise
Than to lack the
longed-for joy.

<END PAGE>
96. This found I myself,
| when I sat in the
reeds,
And long my love
awaited;
As my life the maiden |
<END PAGE>
wise I loved,
Yet her I never had.

97. Billing's daughter |
I found on her bed,
In slumber bright as
<END PAGE>
the sun;
Empty appeared | an
earl's estate
Without that form so
fair.

<END PAGE>
98. "Othin, again | at
evening come,
If a woman thou
wouldst win;
Evil it were | if others
<END PAGE>
than we
Should know of such a
sin."

99. Away I hastened, |
hoping for joy,
<END PAGE>
And careless of
counsel wise;
Well I believed | that
soon I should win
Measureless joy with
<END PAGE>
the maid.

100. So came I next |
when night it was,
The warriors all were
awake;
<END PAGE>
With burning lights |
and waving brands
I learned my luckess
way.

<END PAGE>
101. At morning then, |
when once more I came,
And all were sleeping
still,
A dog found | in the
<END PAGE>
fair one's place,
Bound there upon her
bed.

102. Many fair maids, |
if a man but tries them,
<END PAGE>
False to a lover are
found;
That did I learn | when
I longed to gain
With wiles the maiden
<END PAGE>
wise;
Foul scorn was my
meed | from the crafty
maid,
And nought from the
woman I won.
<END PAGE>
* * *

103. Though glad at
home, | and merry with
guests,
A man shall be wary
<END PAGE>
and wise;
The sage and shrewd, |
wide wisdom seeking,
Must see that his
speech be fair;
A fool is he named |
<END PAGE>
who nought can say,
For such is the way of
the witless.

104. I found the old
<END PAGE>
giant, | now back have I
fared,
Small gain from silence
I got;
Full many a word, | my
will to get,
I spoke in Suttung's
<END PAGE>
hall.

105. The mouth of Rati |
made room for my
passage,
And space in the stone
<END PAGE>
he gnawed;
Above and below | the
giants' paths lay,
So rashly I risked my
head.

<END PAGE>
106. Gunnloth gave | on
a golden stool
A drink of the
marvelous mead;
A harsh reward | did I
<END PAGE>
let her have
For her heroic heart,
And her spirit troubled
sore.

<END PAGE>
107. The well-earned
beauty | well I enjoyed,
Little the wise man
lacks;
So Othrörir now | has
<END PAGE>
up been brought
To the midst of the men
of earth.

108. Hardly, methinks, |
<END PAGE>
would I home have
come,
And left the giants'
land,
Had not Gunnloth
helped me, | the maiden
<END PAGE>
good,
Whose arms about me
had been.

109. The day that
<END PAGE>
followed, | the
frost-giants came,
Some word of Hor to
win,
(And into the hall of
Hor;)
Of Bolverk they asked,
<END PAGE>
| were he back midst
the gods,
Or had Suttung slain
him there?

110. On his ring swore
<END PAGE>
Othin | the oath,
methinks;
Who now his troth shall
trust?
Suttung's betrayal | he
sought with drink,
And Gunnloth to grief
<END PAGE>
he left.
* * *

111. It is time to chant |
from the chanter's
stool;
<END PAGE>
By the wells of Urth I
was,
I saw and was silent, | I
saw and thought,
And heard the speech
<END PAGE>
of Hor.
(Of runes heard I
words, | nor were
counsels wanting,
At the hall of Hor,
In the hall of Hor;
<END PAGE>
Such was the speech I
heard.)

112. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
<END PAGE>
thou my rede,---
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
learnest:
Rise not at night, | save
<END PAGE>
if news thou seekest,
Or fain to the
outhouse wouldst fare.

113. I rede thee,
<END PAGE>
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
learnest:
Beware of sleep | on a
<END PAGE>
witch's bosom,
Nor let her limbs
ensnare thee.

114. Such is her might |
that thou hast no mind
<END PAGE>
For the council or
meeting of men;
Meat thou hatest, | joy
thou hast not,
And sadly to slumber
<END PAGE>
thou farest.

115. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
<END PAGE>
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
learnest:
Seek never to win | the
wife of another,
Or long for her secret

love.

116. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
<END PAGE>
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
learnest:
If o'er mountains or
gulfs | thou fain
wouldst go,
<END PAGE>
Look well to thy food
for the way.

117. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
<END PAGE>
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
learnest:
An evil man | thou must
<END PAGE>
not let
Bring aught of ill to
thee;
For an evil man | will
never make
Reward for a worthy
<END PAGE>
thought.

118. I saw a man | who
was wounded sore
By an evil woman's
word;
<END PAGE>
A lying tongue | his
death-blow launched,
And no word of truth
there was.

<END PAGE>
119. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
<END PAGE>
learnest:
If a friend thou hast |
whom thou fully wilt
trust,
Then fare to find him
oft;
<END PAGE>
For brambles grow |
and waving grass
On the rarely trodden
road.

<END PAGE>
120. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
<END PAGE>
learnest:
A good man find | to
hold in friendship,
And give heed to his
healing charms.

<END PAGE>
121. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,-
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
<END PAGE>
learnest:
Be never the first | to
break with thy friend
The bond that holds
you both;
Care eats the heart |
<END PAGE>
if thou canst not speak
To another all thy
thought.

122. I rede thee,
<END PAGE>
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
learnest:
Exchange of words |
<END PAGE>
with a witless ape
Thou must not ever
make.

123. For never thou
<END PAGE>
mayst | from an evil
man
A good requital get;
But a good man oft |
the greatest love
Through words of
<END PAGE>
praise will win thee.

124. Mingled is love |
when a man can speak
To another all his
thought;
<END PAGE>
Nought is so bad | as
false to be,
No friend speaks only
fair.

<END PAGE>
125. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
<END PAGE>
learnest:
With a worse man speak
not | three words in
dispute,
Ill fares the better oft
When the worse man
<END PAGE>
wields a sword.

126. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,-
Profit thou hast if thou
<END PAGE>
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
learnest:
A shoemaker be, | or a
maker of shafts,
For only thy single
<END PAGE>
self;
If the shoe is ill made, |
or the shaft prove
false,
Then evil of thee men
think.
<END PAGE>
127. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
<END PAGE>
learnest:
If evil thou knowest, |
as evil proclaim it,
And make no friendship
with foes.

<END PAGE>
128. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
<END PAGE>
learnest:
In evil never | joy
shalt thou know,
But glad the good shall
make thee.

<END PAGE>
129. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
<END PAGE>
learnest:
Look not up | when the
battle is on,--
(Like madmen the sons |
of men become,--)
Lest men bewitch thy
<END PAGE>
wits.

130. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,-
Profit thou hast if thou
<END PAGE>
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
learnest:
If thou fain wouldst win
| a woman's love,
And gladness get from
<END PAGE>
her,
Fair be thy promise |
and well fulfilled;
None loathes what
good he gets.

<END PAGE>
131. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,-
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
<END PAGE>
learnest:
I bid thee be wary, |
but be not fearful;
(Beware most with ale
or another's wife,
And third beware | lest
<END PAGE>
a thief outwit thee.)

132. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,-
Profit thou hast if thou
<END PAGE>
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
learnest:
Scorn or mocking |
ne'er shalt thou make
Of a guest or a
<END PAGE>
journey-goer.

133. Oft scarcely he
knows | who sits in the
house
What kind is the man
<END PAGE>
who comes;
None so good is found
| that faults he has
not,
Nor so wicked that
nought he is worth.
<END PAGE>
134. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
<END PAGE>
learnest:
Scorn not ever | the
gray-haired singer,
Oft do the old speak
good;
(Oft from shrivelled
<END PAGE>
skin | come skillful
counsels,
Though it hang with the
hides,
And flap with the pelts,
And is blown with the
<END PAGE>
bellies.)

135. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
<END PAGE>
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
learnest:
Curse not thy guest, |
nor show him thy gate,
Deal well with a man in
<END PAGE>
want.

136. Strong is the beam
| that raised must be
To give an entrance to
all;
<END PAGE>
Give it a ring, | or grim
will be
The wish it would work
on thee.

<END PAGE>
137. I rede thee,
Loddfafnir! | and hear
thou my rede,--
Profit thou hast if thou
hearest,
Great thy gain if thou
<END PAGE>
learnest:
When ale thou
drinkest) | seek might
of earth,
(For earth cures
<END PAGE>
drink, | and fire cures
ills,
The oak cures
tightness, | the ear
cures magic,
Rye cures rupture, |
<END PAGE>
the moon cures rage,
Grass cures the scab,
| and runes the
sword-cut;)
The field absorbs the
flood.
<END PAGE>
138. Now are Hor's
words | spoken in the
hall,
Kind for the kindred of
men,
Cursed for the kindred
<END PAGE>
of giants:
Hail to the speaker, |
and to him who learns!
Profit be his who has
them!
Hail to them who
<END PAGE>
hearken!
* * *

139. I ween that I hung
| on the windy tree,
Hung there for nights
<END PAGE>
full nine;
With the spear I was
wounded, | and offered
I was
To Othin, myself to
myself,
<END PAGE>
On the tree that none |
may ever know
What root beneath it
runs.

<END PAGE>
140. None made me
happy | with loaf or
horn,
And there below I
looked;
I took up the runes, |
<END PAGE>
shrieking I took them,
And forthwith back I
fell.

141. Nine mighty songs |
I got from the son
<END PAGE>
Of Bolthorn, Bestla's
father;
And a drink I got | of
the goodly mead
Poured out from
<END PAGE>
Othrörir.

142. Then began I to
thrive, | and wisdom to
get,
I grew and well I was;
<END PAGE>
Each word led me on |
to another word,
Each deed to another
deed.

<END PAGE>
143. Runes shalt thou
find, | and fateful
signs,
That the king of
singers colored,
And the mighty gods
<END PAGE>
have made;
Full strong the signs, |
full mighty the signs
That the ruler of gods
doth write.

<END PAGE>
144. Othin for the
gods, | Dain for the
elves,
And Dvalin for the
dwarfs,
Alsvith for giants | and
<END PAGE>
all mankind,
And some myself I
wrote.

145. Knowest how one
<END PAGE>
shall write, | knowest
how one shall rede?
Knowest how one shall
tint, | knowest how one
makes trial?
Knowest how one shall
<END PAGE>
ask, | knowest how one
shall offer?
Knowest how one shall
send, | knowest how
one shall sacrifice?

<END PAGE>
146. Better no prayer |
than too big an
offering,
By thy getting measure
thy gift;
Better is none | than
<END PAGE>
too big a sacrifice,
. . . . . . . . . .
So Thund of old wrote |
ere man's race began,
Where he rose on high
| when home he came.
<END PAGE>
* * *

147. The songs I know |
that king's wives know
not,
Nor men that are sons
<END PAGE>
of men;
The first is called help,
| and help it can bring
thee
In sorrow and pain and
sickness.
<END PAGE>
148. A second I know, |
that men shall need
Who leechcraft long to
use;
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
<END PAGE>
149. A third I know, | if
great is my need
Of fetters to hold my
foe;
Blunt do I make | mine
<END PAGE>
enemy's blade,
Nor bites his sword or
staff.

150. A fourth I know, |
if men shall fasten
<END PAGE>
Bonds on my bended
legs;
So great is the charm |
that forth I may go,
The fetters spring
<END PAGE>
from my feet,
Broken the bonds from
my hands.

152. A fifth I know, | if I
see from afar
<END PAGE>
An arrow fly 'gainst
the folk;
It flies not so swift |
that I stop it not,
If ever my eyes behold
<END PAGE>
it.

152. A sixth I know, | if
harm one seeks
With a sapling's roots
to send me;
<END PAGE>
The hero himself | who
wreaks his hate
Shall taste the ill ere I.

153. A seventh I know, |
<END PAGE>
if I see in flames
The hall o'er my
comrades' heads;
It burns not so wide |
that I will not quench it,
I know that song to
<END PAGE>
sing.

154. An eighth I know, |
that is to all
Of greatest good to
learn;
<END PAGE>
When hatred grows |
among heroes' sons,
I soon can set it right.

155. A ninth I know, | if
<END PAGE>
need there comes
To shelter my ship on
the flood;
The wind I calm | upon
the waves,
And the sea I put to
<END PAGE>
sleep.

156. A tenth I know, |
what time I see
House-riders flying on
high;
<END PAGE>
So can I work | that
wildly they go,
Showing their true
shapes,
Hence to their own
<END PAGE>
homes.

157. An eleventh I
know, | if needs I must
lead
To the fight my
<END PAGE>
long-loved friends;
I sing in the shields, |
and in strength they
go
Whole to the field of
fight,
<END PAGE>
Whole from the field of
fight,
And whole they come
thence home.

<END PAGE>
158. A twelfth I know, |
if high on a tree
I see a hanged man
swing;
So do I write | and
<END PAGE>
color the runes
That forth he fares,
And to me talks.

159. A thirteenth I
<END PAGE>
know, | if a thane full
young
With water I sprinkle
well;
He shall not fall, |
though he fares mid
<END PAGE>
the host,
Nor sink beneath the
swords.

160. A fourteenth I
<END PAGE>
know, | if fain I would
name
To men the mighty gods;
All know I well | of the
gods and elves,
Few be the fools know
<END PAGE>
this.

161. A fifteenth I know,
| that before the
doors
Of Delling sang
<END PAGE>
Thjothrörir the dwarf;
Might he sang for the
gods, | and glory for
elves,
And wisdom for
Hroptatyr wise.
<END PAGE>
162. A sixteenth I know,
| if I seek delight
To win from a maiden
wise;
The mind I turn | of the
<END PAGE>
white-armed maid,
And thus change all
her thoughts.

163. A seventeenth I
<END PAGE>
know, | so that seldom
shall go
A maiden young from
me;
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

<END PAGE>
164. Long these songs
| thou shalt,
Loddfafnir,
Seek in vain to sing;
Yet good it were | if
<END PAGE>
thou mightest get them,
Well, if thou wouldst
them learn,
Help, if thou hadst
them.

<END PAGE>
165. An eighteenth I
know, | that ne'er will I
tell
To maiden or wife of
man,--
The best is what none |
<END PAGE>
but one's self doth
know,
So comes the end of
the songs,--
Save only to her | in
whose arms I lie,
Or who else my sister
<END PAGE>
