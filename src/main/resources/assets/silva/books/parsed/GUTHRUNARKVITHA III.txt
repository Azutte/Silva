GUTHRUNARKVITHA III
The Third Lay of Guthrun
<END PAGE>
1. "What thy sorrow,
Atli, | Buthli's son?
Is thy heart
heavy-laden? | Why
laughest thou never?
It would better befit |
<END PAGE>
the warrior far
To speak with men, |
and me to look on."

Atli spake:
2. "It troubles me,
<END PAGE>
Guthrun, | Gjuki's
daughter,
What Herkja here | in
the hall hath told me,
That thou in the bed |
with Thjothrek liest,
Beneath the linen | in
<END PAGE>
lovers' guise."

Guthrun spake:
3. "This shall I | with
oaths now swear,
Swear by the sacred |
<END PAGE>
stone so white,
That nought was there
| with Thjothmar's son
That man or woman |
may not know.

<END PAGE>
4. "Nor ever once | did
my arms embrace
The hero brave, | the
leader of hosts;
In another manner |
<END PAGE>
our meeting was,
When our sorrows we |
in secret told.

5. "With thirty warriors
| Thjothrek came,
<END PAGE>
Nor of all his men |
doth one remain;
Thou hast murdered my
brothers | and
mail-clad men,
Thou hast murdered all
<END PAGE>
| the men of my race.

6. "Gunnar comes not, |
Hogni I greet not,
No longer I see | my
brothers loved;
<END PAGE>
My sorrow would Hogni
| avenge with the
sword,
Now myself for my
woes | I shall payment
<END PAGE>
win.

7. "Summon Saxi, | the
southrons' king,
For be the boiling |
kettle can hallow."
<END PAGE>
Seven hundred | there
were in the hall,
Ere the queen her
hand | in the kettle
thrust.

<END PAGE>
8. To the bottom she
reached | with hand so
bright,
And forth she brought
| the flashing stones:
Behold, ye warriors, |
<END PAGE>
well am I cleared
Of sin by the kettle's |
sacred boiling.

9. Then Atli's heart | in
happiness laughed,
<END PAGE>
When Guthrun's hand |
unhurt he saw;
Now Herkja shall come
| the kettle to try,
She who grief | for
<END PAGE>
Guthrun planned.

10. Ne'er saw man sight
| more sad than this,
How burned were the
hands | of Herkja then;
<END PAGE>
