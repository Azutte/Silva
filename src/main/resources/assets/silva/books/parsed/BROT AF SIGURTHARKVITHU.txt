BROT AF SIGURTHARKVITHU
Fragment of a Sigurth Lay
<END PAGE>
1. "(What evil deed |
has Sigurth) done,
That the hero's life |
thou fain wouldst
have?"

Gunnar spake:
2. "Sigurth oaths | to
me hath sworn,
Oaths hath sworn, | and
all hath broken;
<END PAGE>
He betrayed me there |
where truest all
His oaths, methinks, | he
ought to have kept."

Hogni spake:
3. "Thy heart hath
Brynhild | whetted to
hate,
Evil to work | and harm
to win,
<END PAGE>
She grudges the honor
| that Guthrun has,
And that joy of
herself | thou still dost
have."

4. They cooked a wolf, |
they cut up a snake,
They gave to Gotthorm
| the greedy one's
flesh,
<END PAGE>
Before the men, | to
murder minded,
Laid their hands | on
the hero bold.

5. Slain was Sigurth |
south of the Rhine;
From a limb a raven |
called full loud:
Your blood shall
redden | Atli's blade,
<END PAGE>
And your oaths shall
bind | you both in
chains.

6. Without stood
Guthrun, | Gjuki's
daughter,

Hear now the speech |
that first she spake:
Where is Sigurth now, |
the noble king,
<END PAGE>
That my kinsmen riding |
before him come?

7. Only this | did Hogni
answer:
Sigurth we | with our
swords have slain;
The gray horse
mourns | by his master
dead.

<END PAGE>
8. Then Brynhild spake,
| the daughter of
Buthli:
Well shall ye joy | in
weapons and lands;
Sigurth alone | of all
had been lord,
If a little longer | his
life had been.

<END PAGE>
9. Right were it not |
that so he should rule
O'er Gjuki's wealth |
and the race of the
Goths;
Five are the sons | for
ruling the folk,
And greedy of fight, |
that he hath fathered."

<END PAGE>
10. Then Brynhild
laughed-- | and the
building echoed--
Only once, | with all her
heart;
Long shall ye joy | in
lands and men,
Now ye have slain | the
hero noble.

<END PAGE>
11. Then Guthrun
spake, | the daughter
of Gjuki:
Much thou speakest | in
evil speech;
Accursed be Gunnar, |
Sigurth's killer,
Vengeance shall come |
for his cruel heart.

<END PAGE>
12. Early came evening,
| and ale was drunk,
And among them long |
and loud they talked.;
They slumbered all |
when their beds they
sought,
But Gunnar alone | was
long awake.

<END PAGE>
13. His feet were
tossing, | he talked to
himself,
And the slayer of
hosts | began to heed
What the twain from the
tree | had told him
then,
The raven and eagle, |
as home they rode.

<END PAGE>
14. Brynhild awoke, |
the daughter of Buthli,
The warrior's
daughter, | ere dawn
of day:
Love me or hate me, |
the harm is done,
And my grief cries out,
| or else I die.

<END PAGE>
15. Silent were all | who
heard her speak,
And nought of the
heart | of the queen
they knew,
Who wept such tears |
the thing to tell
That laughing once | of
the men she had won.

<END PAGE>
Brynhild spake:
16. "Gunnar, I dreamed
| a dream full grim:
In the hall were
corpses; | cold was my
bed;
And, ruler, thou | didst
joyless ride,
With fetters bound | in
the foemen's throng.

<END PAGE>
17. ". . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
Utterly now your |
Niflung race
All shall die; | your
oaths ye have broken.

18. "Thou hast, Gunnar,
| the deed forgot,
When blood in your
footprints | both ye
mingled;
<END PAGE>
All to him | hast repaid
with ill
Who fain had made thee
| the foremost of kings.

19. "Well did he prove, |
when proud he rode
To win me then | thy
wife to be,
How true the
host-slayer | ever had
held
<END PAGE>
The oaths he had made
| with the monarch
young.

20. "The wound-staff
then, | all wound with
gold,
The hero let | between
us lie;
With fire the edge | was
forged full keen,
<END PAGE>
And with drops of
venom | the blade was
damp."
Here it is told in this
poem about the death
of Sigurth, and the
story goes here that
they slew him out of
doors, but some say
that they slew him in
the house, on his bed
<END PAGE>
while he was sleeping.
But German men say
that they killed him out
of doors in the forest;
and so it is
told in the old Guthrun
lay, that Sigurth and
Gjuki's sons had
ridden to the
council-place, and that
he was
