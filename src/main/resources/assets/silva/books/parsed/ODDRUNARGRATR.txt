ODDRUNARGRATR
The Lament of Oddrun
<END PAGE>
1. I have heard it told |
in olden tales
How a maiden came | to
Morningland;
No one of all | on
earth above
To Heithrek's daughter
| help could give.

<END PAGE>
2. This Oddrun learned,
| the sister of Atli,
That sore the maiden's
| sickness was;
The bit-bearer forth |
from his stall she
brought,
And the saddle laid | on
the steed so black.

<END PAGE>
3. She let the horse go
| o'er the level ground,
Till she reached the
hall | that loftily rose,
(And in she went | from
the end of the hall;)
From the weary steed |
the saddle she took;

<END PAGE>
Hear now the speech |
that first she spake:
4. "What news on earth,
| . . . . .
Or what has happened |
in Hunland now?"

A serving-maid spake:
Here Borgny lies | in
bitter pain,
Thy friend, and,
Oddrun, | thy help
would find.
<END PAGE>
Oddrun spake:
5. 'Who worked this woe
| for the woman thus,
Or why so sudden | is
Borgny sick?"

The serving-maid
spake:
Vilmund is he, | the
heroes' friend,
Who wrapped the woman
| in bedclothes warm,
<END PAGE>
(For winters five, | yet
her father knew not).

6. Then no more | they
spake, methinks;
She went at the knees |
of the woman to sit;
With magic Oddrun | and
mightily Oddrun
Chanted for Borgny |
potent charms.
<END PAGE>
7. At last were born | a
boy and girl,
Son and daughter | of
Hogni's slayer;
Then speech the woman
| so weak began,

Nor said she aught |
ere this she spake:
8. "So may the holy |
ones thee help,
<END PAGE>
Frigg and Freyja | and
favoring gods,
As thou hast saved me
| from sorrow now."

Oddrun spake:
9. "I came not hither |
to help thee thus
Because thou ever | my
aid didst earn;
I fulfilled the oath |
that of old I swore,
<END PAGE>
That aid to all | I
should ever bring,
(When they shared the
wealth | the warriors
had)."

Borgny spake:
10. "Wild art thou,
Oddrun, | and witless
now,
That so in hatred | to
me thou speakest;
<END PAGE>
I followed thee | where
thou didst fare,
As we had been born |
of brothers twain."

Oddrun spake:
11. "I remember the
evil | one eve thou
spakest,
When a draught I gave
| to Gunnar then;
<END PAGE>
Thou didst say that
never | such a deed
By maid was done |
save by me alone."

12. Then the sorrowing
woman | sat her down
To tell the grief | of
her troubles great.

<END PAGE>
13. "Happy I grew | in
the hero's hall
As the warriors wished,
| and they loved me
well;
Glad I was | of my
father's gifts,
For winters five, | while
my father lived.

<END PAGE>
14. "These were the
words | the weary king,

Ere he died, | spake
last of all:
He bade me with red
gold | dowered to be,
And to Grimhild's son |
in the South be wedded.

<END PAGE>
15. "But Brynhild the
helm | he bade to wear,
A wish-maid bright | he
said she should be;
For a nobler maid |
would never be born
On earth, he said, | if
death should spare
her.

<END PAGE>
16. "At her weaving
Brynhild | sat in her
bower,
Lands and folk | alike
she had;
The earth and heaven |
high resounded
When Fafnir's slayer |
the city saw.

<END PAGE>
17. "Then battle was
fought | with the
foreign swords,
And the city was
broken | that Brynhild
had;
Not long thereafter, |
but all too soon,
Their evil wiles | full
well she knew.

<END PAGE>
18. "Woeful for this |
her vengeance was,
As so we learned | to
our sorrow all;
In every land | shall
all men hear
How herself at
Sigurth's | side she
slew.

<END PAGE>
19. "Love to Gunnar |
then I gave,
To the breaker of
rings, | as Brynhild
might;
To Atli rings | so red
they offered,
And mighty gifts | to my
brother would give.

<END PAGE>
20. "Fifteen dwellings |
fain would he give
For me, and the burden
| that Grani bore;
But Atli said | he would
never receive
Marriage gold | from
Gjuki's son.

<END PAGE>
21. "Yet could we not |
our love o'ercome,
And my head I laid | on
the hero's shoulder;
Many there were | of
kinsmen mine
Who said that together
| us they had seen.

<END PAGE>
22. "Atli said | that
never I
Would evil plan, | or ill
deed do;
But none may this | of
another think,
Or surely speak, | when
love is shared.

<END PAGE>
23. "Soon his men | did
Atli send,
In the murky wood | on
me to spy;
Thither they came |
where they should not
come,
Where beneath one
cover | close we lay.

<END PAGE>
24. "To the warriors
ruddy | rings we
offered,
That nought to Atli |
e'er they should say;
But swiftly home | they
hastened thence,
And eager all | to Atli
told.

<END PAGE>
25. "But close from
Guthrun | kept they hid
What first of all | she
ought to have known.
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

26. "Great was the
clatter | of gilded
hoofs
When Gjuki's sons |
through the gateway
rode;
<END PAGE>
The heart they hewed |
from Hogni then,
And the other they
cast | in the serpents'
cave.

27. "The hero wise | on
his harp then smote,
. . . . . . . . . .
For help from me | in
his heart yet hoped
<END PAGE>
The high-born king, |
might come to him.

28. "Alone was I gone |
to Geirmund then,
The draught to mix |
and ready to make;
Sudden I heard | from
Hlesey clear
How in sorrow the
strings | of the harp
resounded.
<END PAGE>
29. "I bade the
serving-maids | ready
to be,
For I longed the
hero's | life to save;
Across the sound | the
boats we sailed,
Till we saw the whole |
of Atli's home.

<END PAGE>
30. "Then crawling the
evil | woman came,
Atli's mother-- | may
she ever rot!
And hard she bit | to
Gunnar's heart,
So I could not help |
the hero brave.

<END PAGE>
31. "Oft have I
wondered | how after
this,
Serpents'-bed
goddess! | I still might
live,
For well I loved | the
warrior brave,
The giver of swords, |
as my very self.
