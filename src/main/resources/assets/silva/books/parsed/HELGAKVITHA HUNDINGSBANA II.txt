HELGAKVITHA HUNDINGSBANA II
The Second Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane
<END PAGE>
1. "Say to HÃ¦ming | that
Helgi knows
Whom the heroes | in
armor hid;
A gray wolf had they |
<END PAGE>
within their hall,
Whom King Hunding |
Hamal thought."
Hamal was the name of
Hagal's son. King
Hunding
<END PAGE>
sent men to Hagal to
seek Helgi, and Helgi
could not save himself
in any other way, so he
put on the
clothes of a
<END PAGE>
bond-woman and set to
work at the mill. They
sought Helgi but found
him not.

2. Then Blind spake out,
| the evil-minded:
 Of Hagal's
<END PAGE>
bond-woman | bright
are the eyes;
Yon comes not of
churls | who stands at
the quern;
The millstones break, |
<END PAGE>
the boards are
shattered.

3. The hero has | a
doom full hard,
That barley now | he
<END PAGE>
needs must grind;
Better befits | his hand
to feel
The hilt of the sword |
than the millstone's
handle."
<END PAGE>
Hagal answered and
said:

4. "Small is the wonder
| if boards are
<END PAGE>
splintered
By a monarch's
daughter | the mill is
turned;
Once through clouds |
she was wont to ride,
<END PAGE>
And battles fought |
like fighting men,
(Till Helgi a captive |
held her fast;
Sister she is | of Sigar
<END PAGE>
and Hogni,
Thus bright are the
eyes | of the Ylfings'
maid.)"
Helgi escaped and went
<END PAGE>
to a fighting ship. He
slew King Hunding, and
thenceforth was called
Helgi
Hundingsbane.
(II)
He lay with his host in
<END PAGE>
Brunavagar, and they
had there a
strand-slaughtering,
and ate the flesh raw.
Hogni
was the name of a king.
<END PAGE>
His daughter was
Sigrun; she was a
Valkyrie and rode air
and water; she was
Svava reborn. Sigrun
rode to Helgi's ship
and said:

<END PAGE>
5. "Who rules the ship |
by the shore so
steep?
Where is the home | ye
warriors have?
Why do ye bide | in
<END PAGE>
Brunavagar,
Or what the way | that
ye wish to try?"

Helgi spake:
6 "Hamal's the ship | by
<END PAGE>
the shore so steep,
Our home in Hlesey | do
we have;
For fair wind bide we |
in Brunavagar,
Eastward the way | that
<END PAGE>
we wish to try."

Sigrun spake:
7. "Where hast thou,
warrior, | battle
wakened,
<END PAGE>
Or gorged the birds |
of the sisters of Guth?
Why is thy byrnie |
spattered with blood,
Why helmed dost feast |
<END PAGE>
on food uncooked?"

Helgi spake:
8. "Latest of all, | the
Ylfings' son
On the western sea, | if
<END PAGE>
know thou wilt,
Captured bears | in
Bragalund,
And fed the eagles |
with edge of sword.
Now is it shown | why
<END PAGE>
our shirts are bloody,
And little our food |
with fire is cooked."

Sigrun spake:
9. "Of battle thou
<END PAGE>
tellest, | and there was
bent
Hunding the king |
before Helgi down;
There was carnage
when thou | didst
<END PAGE>
avenge thy kin,
And blood flowed fast |
on the blade of the
sword."

<END PAGE>
Helgi spake:
10. "How didst thou
know | that now our kin,
Maiden wise, | we have
well avenged?
Many there are | of
<END PAGE>
the sons of the mighty
Who share alike | our
lofty race."

Sigrun spake:
11. "Not far was I |
<END PAGE>
from the lord of the
folk,
Yester morn, | when the
monarch was slain;
Though crafty the son
| of Sigmund, methinks,
When he speaks of the
<END PAGE>
fight | in
slaughter-runes.

12. "On the long-ship
once | I saw thee well,
When in the
<END PAGE>
blood-stained | bow
thou wast,
(And round thee icy |
waves were raging;)
Now would the hero |
hide from me,
But to Hogni's
<END PAGE>
daughter | is Helgi
known."
(III)
Granmar was the name
of a mighty king, who
<END PAGE>
dwelt at Svarin's hill.
He had many sons; one
was named
Hothbrodd, another
Gothmund, a third
Starkath. Hothbrodd
<END PAGE>
was in a kings' meeting,
and he won the
promise of having
Sigrun, Hogni's
daughter, for his wife.
But when she heard
<END PAGE>
this, she rode with the
Valkyries over air and
sea to seek Helgi. Helgi
was then at Logafjoll,
and had fought with
Hunding's
<END PAGE>
sons; there he killed
Alf and Eyolf,
Hjorvarth and
Hervarth. He was all
weary with battle, and
<END PAGE>
sat under
the eagle-stone. There
Sigrun found him, and
ran to throw her arms
about his neck, and
kissed him, and
<END PAGE>
told him her tidings, as
is set forth in the old
Volsung lay:

13. Sigrun the joyful |
<END PAGE>
chieftain sought,
Forthwith Helgi's | hand
she took;
She greeted the hero |
helmed and kissed him,
The warrior's heart |
<END PAGE>
to the woman turned.

14. From her heart the
daughter | of Hogni
spake,
Dear was Helgi, | she
<END PAGE>
said, to her;
Long with all | my heart
I loved
Sigmund's son | ere
ever I saw him.

<END PAGE>
15. At the meeting to
Hothbrodd | mated I
was,
But another hero | I
fain would have;
Though, king, the wrath
<END PAGE>
| of my kin I fear,
Since I broke my
father's | fairest wish."

Helgi spake:
16. "Fear not ever |
<END PAGE>
Hogni's anger,
Nor yet thy kinsmen's |
cruel wrath;
Maiden, thou | with me
shalt live,
Thy kindred, fair one, |
<END PAGE>
I shall not fear."
(IV)
Helgi then assembled a
great sea-host and
went to Frekastein. On
<END PAGE>
the sea he met a
perilous storm;
lightning flashed
overhead and the
bolts struck the ship.
<END PAGE>
They saw in the air
that nine Valkyries
were
riding, and recognized
Sigrun among them.
Then the storm abated,
<END PAGE>
and they came safe
and sound to land.
Granmar's sons sat on
a certain mountain as
the ships sailed toward
the land. Gothmund
<END PAGE>
leaped on a
horse and rode for
news to a promontory
near the harbor; the
Volsungs were even
then lowering their
<END PAGE>
sails. Then Gothmund
said, as is written
before in the Helgi lay:
Who is the king | who
captains the fleet,
And to the land | the
<END PAGE>
warriors leads?
Sinfjotli, Sigmund's son,
answered him, and that
too is written.
Gothmund rode home
<END PAGE>
with his tidings of the
host;
then Granmar's sons
summoned an army.
Many kings came there;
there were Hogni,
<END PAGE>
Sigrun's father, and
his sons Bragi and Dag.
There was a great
battle, and all
Granmar's sons were
<END PAGE>
slain and all their
allies;
only Dag, Hogni's son,
was spared, and he
swore loyalty to the
Volsungs. Sigrun went
<END PAGE>
among the dead
and found Hothbrodd
at the coming of death.
She said:

<END PAGE>
17. "Never shall Sigrun
| from Sevafjoll,
Hothbrodd king, | be
held in thine arms;
Granmar's sons | full
<END PAGE>
cold have grown,
And the giant-steeds
gray | on corpses
gorge."
Then she sought out
<END PAGE>
Helgi, and was full of
joy He said:

18. "Maid, not fair | is
all thy fortune,
The Norris I blame |
<END PAGE>
that this should be;
This morn there fell |
at Frekastein
Bragi and Hogni |
beneath my hand.

<END PAGE>
19. "At Hlebjorg fell |
the sons of Hrollaug,
Starkath the king | at
Styrkleifar;
Fighters more noble |
<END PAGE>
saw I never,
The body fought | when
the head had fallen.

20. "On the ground full
<END PAGE>
low | the slain are
lying,
Most are there | of the
men of thy race;
Nought hast thou won, |
for thy fate it was
Brave men to bring | to
<END PAGE>
the battle-field."
Then Sigrun wept. |
Helgi said:

21. "Grieve not, Sigrun,
| the battle is gained,
<END PAGE>
The fighter can shun
not his fate."

Sigrun spake:
To life would I call |
<END PAGE>
them who slaughtered
lie,
If safe on thy breast I
might be.
(V)
This Gothmund the son
<END PAGE>
of Granmar spoke:

22. "What hero great |
is guiding the ships?
A golden flag | on the
stem he flies;
<END PAGE>
I find not peace in |
the van of your faring,
And round the fighters
| is battle-light red."

<END PAGE>
Sinfjotli spake:
23. "Here may
Hothbrodd | Helgi find,
The hater of flight, | in
the midst of the fleet;
The home of all | thy
<END PAGE>
race he has,
And over the realm | of
the fishes he rules."

Gothmund spake:
24. "First shall swords
<END PAGE>
| at Frekastein
Prove our worth | in
place of words;
Time is it, Hothbrodd, |
vengeance to have,
If in battle worsted |
<END PAGE>
once we were."

Sinfjotli spake:
25. "Better, Gothmund, |
to tend the goats,
And climb the rocks |
<END PAGE>
of the mountain cliffs;
A hazel switch | to hold
in thy hand
More seemly were |
than the hilt of a
sword."
<END PAGE>
Helgi spake:
26. "Better, Sinfjotli, |
thee 'twould beseem
Battles to give, | and
eagles to gladden,
Than vain and empty |
<END PAGE>
speech to utter,
Though warriors oft |
with words do strive.

27. "Good I find not |
the sons of Granmar,
<END PAGE>
But for heroes 'tis
seemly | the truth to
speak;
At Moinsheimar | proved
the men
That hearts for the
<END PAGE>
wielding | of swords
they had,
(And ever brave | the
warriors are.)"
(VI)
Helgi took Sigrun to
<END PAGE>
wife, and they had
sons. Helgi did not
reach old age. Dag, the
son of Hogni, offered
sacrifice to Othin to be
avenged for his
<END PAGE>
father's death; Othin
gave Dag his spear.
Dag found Helgi, his
brother-in-law, at a
place which is called
Fjoturlund. He thrust
<END PAGE>
the spear through
Helgi's body. Then
Helgi fell, and Dag rode
to Sevafjoll and told
Sigrun the tidings:

<END PAGE>
28. "Sad am I, sister, |
sorrow to tell thee,
Woe to my kin | unwilling
I worked;
In the morn there fell |
<END PAGE>
at Fjoturlund
The noblest prince |
the world has known,
(And his heel he set |
on the heroes'
necks.)"
<END PAGE>
Sigrun spake:
29. "Now may every |
oath thee bite
That with Helgi | sworn
thou hast,
By the water | bright
<END PAGE>
of Leipt,
And the ice-cold |
stone of Uth.

30. "The ship shall sail
<END PAGE>
not | in which thou
sailest,
Though a favoring wind
| shall follow after;
The horse shall run
not | whereon thou
<END PAGE>
ridest,
Though fain thou art |
thy foe to flee.

31. . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
<END PAGE>
The sword shall bite
not | which thou
bearest,
Till thy head itself | it
sings about.

<END PAGE>
32. Vengeance were
mine | for Helgi's
murder,
Wert thou a wolf | in
the woods without,
Possessing nought |
<END PAGE>
and knowing no joy,
Having no food | save
corpses to feed on."

Dag spake:
33. "Mad art thou,
<END PAGE>
sister, | and wild of
mind,
Such a curse | on thy
brother to cast;
Othin is ruler | of
every ill,
Who sunders kin | with
<END PAGE>
runes of spite.

34. "Thy brother rings
| so red will give thee,
All Vandilsve | and
Vigdalir;
<END PAGE>
Take half my land | to
pay the harm,
Ring-decked maid, | and
as meed for thy sons."

<END PAGE>
Sigrun spake:
35. "I shall sit not
happy | at Sevafjoll,
Early or late, | my life
to love,
If the light cannot
<END PAGE>
show, | in the leader's
band,
VigblÃ¦r bearing him |
back to his home,
(The golden-bitted; | I
shall greet him never.)

<END PAGE>
36. "Such the fear |
that Helgi's foes
Ever felt, | and all
their kin,
As makes the goats |
<END PAGE>
with terror mad
Run from the wolf |
among the rocks.

37. "Helgi rose | above
heroes all
<END PAGE>
Like the lofty ash |
above lowly thorns,
Or the noble stag, |
with dew besprinkled,
Bearing his head |
<END PAGE>
above all beasts,
(And his horns gleam
bright | to heaven
itself.)
A hill was made in
<END PAGE>
Helgi's memory. And
when he
came to Valhall, then
Othin bade him rule
over every thing with
himself.
(VII)
<END PAGE>
Helgi said:
A "Thou shalt, Hunding,
| of every hero
Wash the feet, | and
kindle the fire,
Tie up dogs, | and tend
<END PAGE>
the horses,
And feed the swine |
ere to sleep thou
goest."
(VIII)
One of Sigrun's
<END PAGE>
maidens went one
evening to Helgi's hill,
and saw that Helgi
rode to the hill with
many
men, The maiden said:

<END PAGE>
39. "Is this a dream |
that methinks I see,
Or the doom of the
gods, | that dead men
ride,
And hither spurring |
<END PAGE>
urge your steeds,
Or is home-coming now |
to the heroes
granted?"

<END PAGE>
Helgi spake:
40. "No dream is this |
that thou thinkest to
see,
Nor the end of the
<END PAGE>
world, | though us thou
beholdest,
And hither spurring |
we urge our steeds,
Nor is home-coming now
| to the heroes
<END PAGE>
granted."
The maiden went home
and said to Sigrun:

41. "Go forth, Sigrun, |
from Sevafjoll,
<END PAGE>
If fain the lord | of the
folk wouldst find;
(The hill is open, | Helgi
is come;)
The sword-tracks
<END PAGE>
bleed; | the monarch
bade
That thou his wounds |
shouldst now make
well."
Sigrun went in the hill
<END PAGE>
to Helgi, and said:

42. "Now am I glad | of
our meeting together,
As Othin's hawks, | so
eager for prey,
<END PAGE>
When slaughter and
flesh | all warm they
scent,
Or dew-wet see | the
red of day.

<END PAGE>
43. "First will I kiss |
the lifeless king,
Ere off the bloody |
byrnie thou cast;
With frost thy hair | is
<END PAGE>
heavy, Helgi,
And damp thou art |
with the dew of death;
(Ice-cold hands | has
Hogni's kinsman,
What, prince, can I | to
<END PAGE>
bring thee ease?)"

Helgi spake:
44. "Thou alone, Sigrun
| of Sevafjoll,
Art cause that Helgi |
<END PAGE>
with dew is heavy;
Gold-decked maid, | thy
tears are grievous,
(Sun-bright
south-maid, | ere thou
sleepest;)
<END PAGE>
Each falls like blood |
on the hero's breast,
(Burned-out, cold, |
and crushed with
care.)

<END PAGE>
45. "Well shall we drink
| a noble draught,
Though love and lands
| are lost to me;
No man a song | of
<END PAGE>
sorrow shall sing,
Though bleeding
wounds | are on my
breast;
Now in the hill | our
brides we hold,
<END PAGE>
The heroes' loves, | by
their husbands dead."
Sigrun made ready a
bed in the hill.

<END PAGE>
46. "Here a bed | I
have made for thee,
Helgi,
To rest thee from
care, | thou kin of the
<END PAGE>
Ylfings;
I will make thee sink | to
sleep in my arms,
As once I lay | with the
living king."

<END PAGE>
Helgi spake:
47. "Now do I say | that
in Sevafjoll
Aught may happen, |
early or late,
Since thou sleepest
<END PAGE>
clasped | in a corpse's
arms,
So fair in the hill, | the
daughter of Hogni!
(Living thou comest, | a
daughter of kings.)

<END PAGE>
48. "Now must I ride |
the reddened ways,
And my bay steed set |
to tread the sky;
Westward I go | to
<END PAGE>
wind-helm's bridges,
Ere Salgofnir wakes |
the warrior throng."
Then Helgi and his
followers rode on
their way, and
<END PAGE>
the women went home to
the dwelling. Another
evening Sigrun bade
the maiden keep watch
at the hill.
And at sunset when
<END PAGE>
Sigrun came to the hill
she said:

49. "Now were he come,
| if come he might,
Sigmund's son, | from
<END PAGE>
Othin's seat;
Hope grows dim | of the
hero's return
When eagles sit | on
the ash-tree boughs,
And men are seeking |
<END PAGE>
the meeting of dreams."
The Maiden said:

50. "Mad thou wouldst
seem | alone to seek,
Daughter of heroes, |
<END PAGE>
the house of the dead;
For mightier now | at
night are all
The ghosts of the
dead | than when day is
bright."
<END PAGE>
Sigrun was early dead
of sorrow and grief. It
was believed in olden
times that people were
born again,
but that is now called
<END PAGE>
old wives' folly. Of
Helgi and Sigrun it is
said that they were
born again; he
became Helgi
Haddingjaskati, and
<END PAGE>
