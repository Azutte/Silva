GUTHRUNARHVOT
Guthrun's Inciting
<END PAGE>
1. A word-strife I
learned, | most woeful
of all,
A speech from the
fullness | of sorrow
<END PAGE>
spoken,
When fierce of heart |
her sons to the fight
Did Guthrun whet | with
words full grim.

<END PAGE>
2. "Why sit ye idle, | why
sleep out your lives,
Why grieve ye not | in
gladness to speak?
Since Jormunrek | your
<END PAGE>
sister young
Beneath the hoofs | of
horses hath trodden,
(White and black | on
the battle-way,
Gray, road-wonted, |
<END PAGE>
the steeds of the
Goths.)

3. "Not like are ye | to
Gunnar of yore,
Nor have ye hearts |
<END PAGE>
such as Hogni's was;
Vengeance for her |
ye soon would have
If brave ye were | as
my brothers of old,
Or hard your hearts |
<END PAGE>
as the Hunnish kings'."

4. Then Hamther spake,
| the high of heart:
Little the deed | of
Hogni didst love,
<END PAGE>
When Sigurth they
wakened | from his
sleep;
Thy bed-covers white |
were red with blood
Of thy husband,
<END PAGE>
drenched | with gore
from his heart.

5. Bloody revenge |
didst have for thy
brothers,
Evil and sore, | when
<END PAGE>
thy sons didst slay;
Else yet might we all |
on Jormunrek
Together our sister's |
slaying avenge.

<END PAGE>
6. . . . . . . . . . .
The gear of the
Hunnish | kings now
give us!
Thou hast whetted us
<END PAGE>
so | to the battle of
swords."

7. Laughing did Guthrun
| go to her chamber,
The helms of the kings
<END PAGE>
| from the cupboards
she took,
And mail-coats broad, |
to her sons she bore
them;
On their horses' backs
<END PAGE>
| the heroes leaped.

8. Then Hamther spake,
| the high of heart:
Homeward no more | his
mother to see
<END PAGE>
Comes the spear-god, |
fallen mid Gothic folk;
One death-draught
thou | for us all shalt
drink,
For Svanhild then | and
<END PAGE>
thy sons as well.

9. Weeping Guthrun, |
Gjuki's daughter,
Went sadly before | the
gate to sit,
<END PAGE>
And with tear-stained
cheeks | to tell the tale
Of her mighty griefs, |
so many in kind.

<END PAGE>
10. "Three home-fires
knew I, | three hearths
I knew,
Home was I brought |
by husbands three;
But Sigurth only | of all
<END PAGE>
was dear,
He whom my brothers |
brought to his death.

11. "A greater sorrow
| I saw not nor knew,
<END PAGE>
Yet more it seemed | I
must suffer yet
When the princes great
| to Atli gave me.

<END PAGE>
12. "The brave boys I
summoned | to secret
speech;
For my woes requital |
I might not win
Till off the heads | of
<END PAGE>
the Hniflungs I hewed.

13. "To the sea I went,
| my heart full sore
For the Norns, whose
<END PAGE>
wrath | I would now
escape;
But the lofty billows |
bore me undrowned,
Till to land I came, | so
I longer must live.

<END PAGE>
14. "Then to the bed--
| of old was it better!--
Of a king of the folk | a
third time I came;
Boys I bore | his heirs
<END PAGE>
to be,
Heirs so young, | the
sons of Jonak.

15. "But round Svanhild
| handmaidens sat,
<END PAGE>
She was dearest ever |
of all my children;
So did Svanhild | seem
in my hall
As the ray of the sun |
<END PAGE>
is fair to see.

16. "Gold I gave her |
and garments bright,
Ere I let her go | to
the Gothic folk;
<END PAGE>
Of my heavy woes | the
hardest it was
When Svanhild's
tresses | fair were
trodden
In the mire by hoofs |
<END PAGE>
of horses wild.

17. "The sorest it was |
when Sigurth mine
On his couch, of
<END PAGE>
victory | robbed, they
killed;
And grimmest of all |
when to Gunnar's
heart
There crept the
<END PAGE>
bright-hued | crawling
snakes.

18. "And keenest of all
| when they cut the
heart
From the living breast |
<END PAGE>
of the king so brave;
Many woes I remember,
| . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

<END PAGE>
19. "Bridle, Sigurth, |
thy steed so black,
Hither let run | thy
swift-faring horse;
Here there sits not |
<END PAGE>
son or daughter
Who yet to Guthrun |
gifts shall give.

20. "Remember, Sigurth,
| what once we said,
<END PAGE>
When together both |
on the bed we sat,
That mightily thou | to
me wouldst come
From hell and I | from
<END PAGE>
earth to thee.

21. "Pile ye up, jarls, |
the pyre of oak,
Make it the highest | a
hero e'er had;
<END PAGE>
Let the fire burn | my
grief-filled breast,
My sore-pressed
heart, | till my sorrows
melt."

<END PAGE>
22. May nobles all |
less sorrow know,
And less the woes | of
women become,
Since the tale of this |
<END PAGE>
