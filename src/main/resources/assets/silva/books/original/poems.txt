TITLE	VOLUSPO
SUBTITLE	The Wise-Woman's Prophecy
POEM	1. Hearing I ask | from the holy races,
POEM	From Heimdall's sons, | both high and low;
POEM	Thou wilt, Valfather, | that well I relate
POEM	Old tales I remember | of men long ago.
POEM	
POEM	2. I remember yet | the giants of yore,
POEM	Who gave me bread | in the days gone by;
POEM	Nine worlds I knew, | the nine in the tree
POEM	With mighty roots | beneath the mold.
POEM	
POEM	3. Of old was the age | when Ymir lived;
POEM	Sea nor cool waves | nor sand there were;
POEM	Earth had not been, | nor heaven above,
POEM	But a yawning gap, | and grass nowhere.
POEM	
POEM	4. Then Bur's sons lifted | the level land,
POEM	Mithgarth the mighty | there they made;
POEM	The sun from the south | warmed the stones of earth,
POEM	And green was the ground | with growing leeks.
POEM	
POEM	5. The sun, the sister | of the moon, from the south
POEM	Her right hand cast | over heaven's rim;
POEM	No knowledge she had | where her home should be,
POEM	The moon knew not | what might was his,
POEM	The stars knew not | where their stations were.
POEM	
POEM	6. Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,
POEM	The holy ones, | and council held;
POEM	Names then gave they | to noon and twilight,
POEM	Morning they named, | and the waning moon,
POEM	Night and evening, | the years to number.
POEM	
POEM	7. At Ithavoll met | the mighty gods,
POEM	Shrines and temples | they timbered high;
POEM	Forges they set, and | they smithied ore,
POEM	Tongs they wrought, | and tools they fashioned.
POEM	
POEM	8. In their dwellings at peace | they played at tables,
POEM	Of gold no lack | did the gods then know,--
POEM	Till thither came | up giant-maids three,
POEM	Huge of might, | out of Jotunheim.
POEM	
POEM	9. Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,
POEM	The holy ones, | and council held,
POEM	To find who should raise | the race of dwarfs
POEM	Out of Brimir's blood | and the legs of Blain.
POEM	
POEM	10. There was Motsognir | the mightiest made
POEM	Of all the dwarfs, | and Durin next;
POEM	Many a likeness | of men they made,
POEM	The dwarfs in the earth, | as Durin said.
POEM	
POEM	11. Nyi and Nithi, | Northri and Suthri,
POEM	Austri and Vestri, | Althjof, Dvalin,
POEM	Nar and Nain, | Niping, Dain,
POEM	Bifur, Bofur, | Bombur, Nori,
POEM	An and Onar, | Ai, Mjothvitnir.
POEM	
POEM	12. Vigg and Gandalf) | Vindalf, Thrain,
POEM	Thekk and Thorin, | Thror, Vit and Lit,
POEM	Nyr and Nyrath,-- | now have I told--
POEM	Regin and Rathsvith-- | the list aright.
POEM	
POEM	13. Fili, Kili, | Fundin, Nali,
POEM	Heptifili, | Hannar, Sviur,
POEM	Frar, Hornbori, | Fræg and Loni,
POEM	Aurvang, Jari, | Eikinskjaldi.
POEM	
POEM	14. The race of the dwarfs | in Dvalin's throng
POEM	Down to Lofar | the list must I tell;
POEM	The rocks they left, | and through wet lands
POEM	They sought a home | in the fields of sand.
POEM	
POEM	15. There were Draupnir | and Dolgthrasir,
POEM	Hor, Haugspori, | Hlevang, Gloin,
POEM	Dori, Ori, | Duf, Andvari,
POEM	Skirfir, Virfir, | Skafith, Ai.
POEM	
POEM	16. Alf and Yngvi, | Eikinskjaldi,
POEM	Fjalar and Frosti, | Fith and Ginnar;
POEM	So for all time | shall the tale be known,
POEM	The list of all | the forbears of Lofar.
POEM	
POEM	17. Then from the throng | did three come forth,
POEM	From the home of the gods, | the mighty and gracious;
POEM	Two without fate | on the land they found,
POEM	Ask and Embla, | empty of might.
POEM	
POEM	18. Soul they had not, | sense they had not,
POEM	Heat nor motion, | nor goodly hue;
POEM	Soul gave Othin, | sense gave Hönir,
POEM	Heat gave Lothur | and goodly hue.
POEM	
POEM	19. An ash I know, | Yggdrasil its name,
POEM	With water white | is the great tree wet;
POEM	Thence come the dews | that fall in the dales,
POEM	Green by Urth's well | does it ever grow.
POEM	
POEM	20. Thence come the maidens | mighty in wisdom,
POEM	Three from the dwelling | down 'neath the tree;
POEM	Urth is one named, | Verthandi the next,--
POEM	On the wood they scored,-- | and Skuld the third.
POEM	Laws they made there, and life allotted
POEM	To the sons of men, and set their fates.
POEM	
POEM	21. The war I remember, | the first in the world,
POEM	When the gods with spears | had smitten Gollveig,
POEM	And in the hall | of Hor had burned her,
POEM	Three times burned, | and three times born,
POEM	Oft and again, | yet ever she lives.
POEM	
POEM	22. Heith they named her | who sought their home,
POEM	The wide-seeing witch, | in magic wise;
POEM	Minds she bewitched | that were moved by her magic,
POEM	To evil women | a joy she was.
POEM	
POEM	23. On the host his spear | did Othin hurl,
POEM	Then in the world | did war first come;
POEM	The wall that girdled | the gods was broken,
POEM	And the field by the warlike | Wanes was trodden.
POEM	
POEM	24. Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,
POEM	The holy ones, | and council held,
POEM	Whether the gods | should tribute give,
POEM	Or to all alike | should worship belong.
POEM	
POEM	25. Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,
POEM	The holy ones, | and council held,
POEM	To find who with venom | the air had filled,
POEM	Or had given Oth's bride | to the giants' brood.
POEM	
POEM	26. In swelling rage | then rose up Thor,--
POEM	Seldom he sits | when he such things hears,--
POEM	And the oaths were broken, | the words and bonds,
POEM	The mighty pledges | between them made.
POEM	
POEM	27. I know of the horn | of Heimdall, hidden
POEM	Under the high-reaching | holy tree;
POEM	On it there pours | from Valfather's pledge
POEM	A mighty stream: | would you know yet more?
POEM	
POEM	28. Alone I sat | when the Old One sought me,
POEM	The terror of gods, | and gazed in mine eyes:
POEM	What hast thou to ask? | why comest thou hither?
POEM	Othin, I know | where thine eye is hidden.
POEM	
POEM	29. I know where Othin's | eye is hidden,
POEM	Deep in the wide-famed | well of Mimir;
POEM	Mead from the pledge | of Othin each mom
POEM	Does Mimir drink: | would you know yet more?
POEM	
POEM	30. Necklaces had I | and rings from Heerfather,
POEM	Wise was my speech | and my magic wisdom;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Widely I saw | over all the worlds.
POEM	
POEM	31. On all sides saw I | Valkyries assemble,
POEM	Ready to ride | to the ranks of the gods;
POEM	Skuld bore the shield, | and Skogul rode next,
POEM	Guth, Hild, Gondul, | and Geirskogul.
POEM	Of Herjan's maidens | the list have ye heard,
POEM	Valkyries ready | to ride o'er the earth.
POEM	
POEM	32. I saw for Baldr, | the bleeding god,
POEM	The son of Othin, | his destiny set:
POEM	Famous and fair | in the lofty fields,
POEM	Full grown in strength | the mistletoe stood.
POEM	
POEM	33. From the branch which seemed | so slender and fair
POEM	Came a harmful shaft | that Hoth should hurl;
POEM	But the brother of Baldr | was born ere long,
POEM	And one night old | fought Othin's son.
POEM	
POEM	34. His hands he washed not, | his hair he combed not,
POEM	Till he bore to the bale-blaze | Baldr's foe.
POEM	But in Fensalir | did Frigg weep sore
POEM	For Valhall's need: | would you know yet more?
POEM	
POEM	35. One did I see | in the wet woods bound,
POEM	A lover of ill, | and to Loki like;
POEM	By his side does Sigyn | sit, nor is glad
POEM	To see her mate: | would you know yet more?
POEM	
POEM	36. From the east there pours | through poisoned vales
POEM	With swords and daggers | the river Slith.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	37. Northward a hall | in Nithavellir
POEM	Of gold there rose | for Sindri's race;
POEM	And in Okolnir | another stood,
POEM	Where the giant Brimir | his beer-hall had.
POEM	
POEM	38. A hall I saw, | far from the sun,
POEM	On Nastrond it stands, | and the doors face north,
POEM	Venom drops | through the smoke-vent down,
POEM	For around the walls | do serpents wind.
POEM	
POEM	39. I saw there wading | through rivers wild
POEM	Treacherous men | and murderers too,
POEM	And workers of ill | with the wives of men;
POEM	There Nithhogg sucked | the blood of the slain,
POEM	And the wolf tore men; | would you know yet more?
POEM	
POEM	40. The giantess old | in Ironwood sat,
POEM	In the east, and bore | the brood of Fenrir;
POEM	Among these one | in monster's guise
POEM	Was soon to steal | the sun from the sky.
POEM	
POEM	41. There feeds he full | on the flesh of the dead,
POEM	And the home of the gods | he reddens with gore;
POEM	Dark grows the sun, | and in summer soon
POEM	Come mighty storms: | would you know yet more?
POEM	
POEM	42. On a hill there sat, | and smote on his harp,
POEM	Eggther the joyous, | the giants' warder;
POEM	Above him the cock | in the bird-wood crowed,
POEM	Fair and red | did Fjalar stand.
POEM	
POEM	43. Then to the gods | crowed Gollinkambi,
POEM	He wakes the heroes | in Othin's hall;
POEM	And beneath the earth | does another crow,
POEM	The rust-red bird | at the bars of Hel.
POEM	
POEM	44. Now Garm howls loud | before Gnipahellir,
POEM	The fetters will burst, | and the wolf run free;
POEM	Much do I know, | and more can see
POEM	Of the fate of the gods, | the mighty in fight.
POEM	
POEM	45. Brothers shall fight | and fell each other,
POEM	And sisters' sons | shall kinship stain;
POEM	Hard is it on earth, | with mighty whoredom;
POEM	Axe-time, sword-time, | shields are sundered,
POEM	Wind-time, wolf-time, | ere the world falls;
POEM	Nor ever shall men | each other spare.
POEM	
POEM	46. Fast move the sons | of Mim, and fate
POEM	Is heard in the note | of the Gjallarhorn;
POEM	Loud blows Heimdall, | the horn is aloft,
POEM	In fear quake all | who on Hel-roads are.
POEM	
POEM	47. Yggdrasil shakes, | and shiver on high
POEM	The ancient limbs, | and the giant is loose;
POEM	To the head of Mim | does Othin give heed,
POEM	But the kinsman of Surt | shall slay him soon.
POEM	
POEM	48. How fare the gods? | how fare the elves?
POEM	All Jotunheim groans, | the gods are at council;
POEM	Loud roar the dwarfs | by the doors of stone,
POEM	The masters of the rocks: | would you know yet more?
POEM	
POEM	49. Now Garm howls loud | before Gnipahellir,
POEM	The fetters will burst, | and the wolf run free
POEM	Much do I know, | and more can see
POEM	Of the fate of the gods, | the mighty in fight.
POEM	
POEM	50. From the east comes Hrym | with shield held high;
POEM	In giant-wrath | does the serpent writhe;
POEM	O'er the waves he twists, | and the tawny eagle
POEM	Gnaws corpses screaming; | Naglfar is loose.
POEM	
POEM	51. O'er the sea from the north | there sails a ship
POEM	With the people of Hel, | at the helm stands Loki;
POEM	After the wolf | do wild men follow,
POEM	And with them the brother | of Byleist goes.
POEM	
POEM	52. Surt fares from the south | with the scourge of branches,
POEM	The sun of the battle-gods | shone from his sword;
POEM	The crags are sundered, | the giant-women sink,
POEM	The dead throng Hel-way, | and heaven is cloven.
POEM	
POEM	53. Now comes to Hlin | yet another hurt,
POEM	When Othin fares | to fight with the wolf,
POEM	And Beli's fair slayer | seeks out Surt,
POEM	For there must fall | the joy of Frigg.
POEM	
POEM	54. Then comes Sigfather's | mighty son,
POEM	Vithar, to fight | with the foaming wolf;
POEM	In the giant's son | does he thrust his sword
POEM	Full to the heart: | his father is avenged.
POEM	
POEM	55. Hither there comes | the son of Hlothyn,
POEM	The bright snake gapes | to heaven above;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Against the serpent | goes Othin's son.
POEM	
POEM	56. In anger smites | the warder of earth,--
POEM	Forth from their homes | must all men flee;-
POEM	Nine paces fares | the son of Fjorgyn,
POEM	And, slain by the serpent, | fearless he sinks.
POEM	
POEM	57. The sun turns black, | earth sinks in the sea,
POEM	The hot stars down | from heaven are whirled;
POEM	Fierce grows the steam | and the life-feeding flame,
POEM	Till fire leaps high | about heaven itself.
POEM	
POEM	58. Now Garm howls loud | before Gnipahellir,
POEM	The fetters will burst, | and the wolf run free;
POEM	Much do I know, | and more can see
POEM	Of the fate of the gods, | the mighty in fight.
POEM	
POEM	59. Now do I see | the earth anew
POEM	Rise all green | from the waves again;
POEM	The cataracts fall, | and the eagle flies,
POEM	And fish he catches | beneath the cliffs.
POEM	
POEM	60. The gods in Ithavoll | meet together,
POEM	Of the terrible girdler | of earth they talk,
POEM	And the mighty past | they call to mind,
POEM	And the ancient runes | of the Ruler of Gods.
POEM	
POEM	61. In wondrous beauty | once again
POEM	Shall the golden tables | stand mid the grass,
POEM	Which the gods had owned | in the days of old,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	62. Then fields unsowed | bear ripened fruit,
POEM	All ills grow better, | and Baldr comes back;
POEM	Baldr and Hoth dwell | in Hropt's battle-hall,
POEM	And the mighty gods: | would you know yet more?
POEM	
POEM	63. Then Hönir wins | the prophetic wand,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	And the sons of the brothers | of Tveggi abide
POEM	In Vindheim now: | would you know yet more?
POEM	
POEM	64. More fair than the sun, | a hall I see,
POEM	Roofed with gold, | on Gimle it stands;
POEM	There shall the righteous | rulers dwell,
POEM	And happiness ever | there shall they have.
POEM	
POEM	65. There comes on high, | all power to hold,
POEM	A mighty lord, | all lands he rules.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	66. From below the dragon | dark comes forth,
POEM	Nithhogg flying | from Nithafjoll;
POEM	The bodies of men on | his wings he bears,
POEM	The serpent bright: | but now must I sink.
TITLE	HOVAMOL
SUBTITLE	The Ballad of the High One
POEM	1. Within the gates | ere a man shall go,
POEM	(Full warily let him watch,)
POEM	Full long let him look about him;
POEM	For little he knows | where a foe may lurk,
POEM	And sit in the seats within.
POEM	
POEM	2. Hail to the giver! | a guest has come;
POEM	Where shall the stranger sit?
POEM	Swift shall he be who, | with swords shall try
POEM	The proof of his might to make.
POEM	
POEM	3. Fire he needs | who with frozen knees
POEM	Has come from the cold without;
POEM	Food and clothes | must the farer have,
POEM	The man from the mountains come.
POEM	
POEM	4. Water and towels | and welcoming speech
POEM	Should he find who comes, to the feast;
POEM	If renown he would get, | and again be greeted,
POEM	Wisely and well must he act.
POEM	
POEM	5. Wits must he have | who wanders wide,
POEM	But all is easy at home;
POEM	At the witless man | the wise shall wink
POEM	When among such men he sits.
POEM	
POEM	6. A man shall not boast | of his keenness of mind,
POEM	But keep it close in his breast;
POEM	To the silent and wise | does ill come seldom
POEM	When he goes as guest to a house;
POEM	(For a faster friend | one never finds
POEM	Than wisdom tried and true.)
POEM	
POEM	7. The knowing guest | who goes to the feast,
POEM	In silent attention sits;
POEM	With his ears he hears, | with his eyes he watches,
POEM	Thus wary are wise men all.
POEM	
POEM	8. Happy the one | who wins for himself
POEM	Favor and praises fair;
POEM	Less safe by far | is the wisdom found
POEM	That is hid in another's heart.
POEM	
POEM	9. Happy the man | who has while he lives
POEM	Wisdom and praise as well,
POEM	For evil counsel | a man full oft
POEM	Has from another's heart.
POEM	
POEM	10. A better burden | may no man bear
POEM	For wanderings wide than wisdom;
POEM	It is better than wealth | on unknown ways,
POEM	And in grief a refuge it gives.
POEM	
POEM	11. A better burden | may no man bear
POEM	For wanderings wide than wisdom;
POEM	Worse food for the journey | he brings not afield
POEM	Than an over-drinking of ale.
POEM	
POEM	12. Less good there lies | than most believe
POEM	In ale for mortal men;
POEM	For the more he drinks | the less does man
POEM	Of his mind the mastery hold.
POEM	
POEM	13. Over beer the bird | of forgetfulness broods,
POEM	And steals the minds of men;
POEM	With the heron's feathers | fettered I lay
POEM	And in Gunnloth's house was held.
POEM	
POEM	14. Drunk I was, | I was dead-drunk,
POEM	When with Fjalar wise I was;
POEM	Tis the best of drinking | if back one brings
POEM	His wisdom with him home.
POEM	
POEM	15. The son of a king | shall be silent and wise,
POEM	And bold in battle as well;
POEM	Bravely and gladly | a man shall go,
POEM	Till the day of his death is come.
POEM	
POEM	16. The sluggard believes | he shall live forever,
POEM	If the fight he faces not;
POEM	But age shall not grant him | the gift of peace,
POEM	Though spears may spare his life.
POEM	
POEM	17. The fool is agape | when he comes to the feast,
POEM	He stammers or else is still;
POEM	But soon if he gets | a drink is it seen
POEM	What the mind of the man is like.
POEM	
POEM	18. He alone is aware | who has wandered wide,
POEM	And far abroad has fared,
POEM	How great a mind | is guided by him
POEM	That wealth of wisdom has.
POEM	
POEM	19. Shun not the mead, | but drink in measure;
POEM	Speak to the point or be still;
POEM	For rudeness none | shall rightly blame thee
POEM	If soon thy bed thou seekest.
POEM	
POEM	20. The greedy man, | if his mind be vague,
POEM	Will eat till sick he is;
POEM	The vulgar man, | when among the wise,
POEM	To scorn by his belly is brought.
POEM	
POEM	21. The herds know well | when home they shall fare,
POEM	And then from the grass they go;
POEM	But the foolish man | his belly's measure
POEM	Shall never know aright.
POEM	
POEM	22. A paltry man | and poor of mind
POEM	At all things ever mocks;
POEM	For never he knows, | what he ought to know,
POEM	That he is not free from faults.
POEM	
POEM	23. The witless man | is awake all night,
POEM	Thinking of many things;
POEM	Care-worn he is | when the morning comes,
POEM	And his woe is just as it was.
POEM	
POEM	24. The foolish man | for friends all those
POEM	Who laugh at him will hold;
POEM	When among the wise | he marks it not
POEM	Though hatred of him they speak.
POEM	
POEM	25. The foolish man | for friends all those
POEM	Who laugh at him will hold;
POEM	But the truth when he comes | to the council he learns,
POEM	That few in his favor will speak.
POEM	
POEM	26. An ignorant man | thinks that all he knows,
POEM	When he sits by himself in a corner;
POEM	But never what answer | to make he knows,
POEM	When others with questions come.
POEM	
POEM	27. A witless man, | when he meets with men,
POEM	Had best in silence abide;
POEM	For no one shall find | that nothing he knows,
POEM	If his mouth is not open too much.
POEM	(But a man knows not, | if nothing he knows,
POEM	When his mouth has been open too much.)
POEM	
POEM	28. Wise shall he seem | who well can question,
POEM	And also answer well;
POEM	Nought is concealed | that men may say
POEM	Among the sons of men.
POEM	
POEM	29. Often he speaks | who never is still
POEM	With words that win no faith;
POEM	The babbling tongue, | if a bridle it find not,
POEM	Oft for itself sings ill.
POEM	
POEM	30. In mockery no one | a man shall hold,
POEM	Although he fare to the feast;
POEM	Wise seems one oft, | if nought he is asked,
POEM	And safely he sits dry-skinned.
POEM	
POEM	31. Wise a guest holds it | to take to his heels,
POEM	When mock of another he makes;
POEM	But little he knows | who laughs at the feast,
POEM	Though he mocks in the midst of his foes.
POEM	
POEM	32. Friendly of mind | are many men,
POEM	Till feasting they mock at their friends;
POEM	To mankind a bane | must it ever be
POEM	When guests together strive.
POEM	
POEM	33. Oft should one make | an early meal,
POEM	Nor fasting come to the feast;
POEM	Else he sits and chews | as if he would choke,
POEM	And little is able to ask.
POEM	
POEM	34. Crooked and far | is the road to a foe,
POEM	Though his house on the highway be;
POEM	But wide and straight | is the way to a friend,
POEM	Though far away he fare.
POEM	
POEM	35. Forth shall one go, | nor stay as a guest
POEM	In a single spot forever;
POEM	Love becomes loathing | if long one sits
POEM	By the hearth in another's home.
POEM	
POEM	36. Better a house, | though a hut it be,
POEM	A man is master at home;
POEM	A pair of goats | and a patched-up roof
POEM	Are better far than begging.
POEM	
POEM	37. Better a house, | though a hut it be,
POEM	A man is master at home;
POEM	His heart is bleeding | who needs must beg
POEM	When food he fain would have.
POEM	
POEM	38. Away from his arms | in the open field
POEM	A man should fare not a foot;
POEM	For never he knows | when the need for a spear
POEM	Shall arise on the distant road.
POEM	
POEM	39. If wealth a man | has won for himself,
POEM	Let him never suffer in need;
POEM	Oft he saves for a foe | what he plans for a friend,
POEM	For much goes worse than we wish.
POEM	
POEM	40. None so free with gifts | or food have I found
POEM	That gladly he took not a gift,
POEM	Nor one who so widely | scattered his wealth
POEM	That of recompense hatred he had.
POEM	
POEM	41. Friends shall gladden each other | with arms and garments,
POEM	As each for himself can see;
POEM	Gift-givers' friendships | are longest found,
POEM	If fair their fates may be.
POEM	
POEM	42. To his friend a man | a friend shall prove,
POEM	And gifts with gifts requite;
POEM	But men shall mocking | with mockery answer,
POEM	And fraud with falsehood meet.
POEM	
POEM	43. To his friend a man | a friend shall prove,
POEM	To him and the friend of his friend;
POEM	But never a man | shall friendship make
POEM	With one of his foeman's friends.
POEM	
POEM	44. If a friend thou hast | whom thou fully wilt trust,
POEM	And good from him wouldst get,
POEM	Thy thoughts with his mingle, | and gifts shalt thou make,
POEM	And fare to find him oft.
POEM	
POEM	45. If another thou hast | whom thou hardly wilt trust,
POEM	Yet good from him wouldst get,
POEM	Thou shalt speak him fair, | but falsely think,
POEM	And fraud with falsehood requite.
POEM	
POEM	46. So is it with him | whom thou hardly wilt trust,
POEM	And whose mind thou mayst not know;
POEM	Laugh with him mayst thou, | but speak not thy mind,
POEM	Like gifts to his shalt thou give.
POEM	
POEM	47. Young was I once, | and wandered alone,
POEM	And nought of the road I knew;
POEM	Rich did I feel | when a comrade I found,
POEM	For man is man's delight.
POEM	
POEM	48. The lives of the brave | and noble are best,
POEM	Sorrows they seldom feed;
POEM	But the coward fear | of all things feels,
POEM	And not gladly the niggard gives.
POEM	
POEM	49. My garments once | in a field I gave
POEM	To a pair of carven poles;
POEM	Heroes they seemed | when clothes they had,
POEM	But the naked man is nought.
POEM	
POEM	50. On the hillside drear | the fir-tree dies,
POEM	All bootless its needles and bark;
POEM	It is like a man | whom no one loves,--
POEM	Why should his life be long?
POEM	
POEM	51. Hotter than fire | between false friends
POEM	Does friendship five days burn;
POEM	When the sixth day comes | the fire cools,
POEM	And ended is all the love.
POEM	
POEM	52. No great thing needs | a man to give,
POEM	Oft little will purchase praise;
POEM	With half a loaf | and a half-filled cup
POEM	A friend full fast I made.
POEM	
POEM	53. A little sand | has a little sea,
POEM	And small are the minds of men;
POEM	Though all men are not | equal in wisdom,
POEM	Yet half-wise only are all.
POEM	
POEM	54. A measure of wisdom | each man shall have,
POEM	But never too much let him know;
POEM	The fairest lives | do those men live
POEM	Whose wisdom wide has grown.
POEM	
POEM	55. A measure of wisdom | each man shall have,
POEM	But never too much let him know;
POEM	For the wise man's heart | is seldom happy,
POEM	If wisdom too great he has won.
POEM	
POEM	56. A measure of wisdom | each man shall have,
POEM	But never too much let him know;
POEM	Let no man the fate | before him see,
POEM	For so is he freest from sorrow.
POEM	
POEM	57. A brand from a brand | is kindled and burned,
POEM	And fire from fire begotten;
POEM	And man by his speech | is known to men,
POEM	And the stupid by their stillness.
POEM	
POEM	58. He must early go forth | who fain the blood
POEM	Or the goods of another would get;
POEM	The wolf that lies idle | shall win little meat,
POEM	Or the sleeping man success.
POEM	
POEM	59. He must early go forth | whose workers are few,
POEM	Himself his work to seek;
POEM	Much remains undone | for the morning-sleeper,
POEM	For the swift is wealth half won.
POEM	
POEM	60. Of seasoned shingles | and strips of bark
POEM	For the thatch let one know his need,
POEM	And how much of wood | he must have for a month,
POEM	Or in half a year he will use.
POEM	
POEM	61. Washed and fed | to the council fare,
POEM	But care not too much for thy clothes;
POEM	Let none be ashamed | of his shoes and hose,
POEM	Less still of the steed he rides,
POEM	(Though poor be the horse he has.)
POEM	
POEM	62. When the eagle comes | to the ancient sea,
POEM	He snaps and hangs his head;
POEM	So is a man | in the midst of a throng,
POEM	Who few to speak for him finds.
POEM	
POEM	63. To question and answer | must all be ready
POEM	Who wish to be known as wise;
POEM	Tell one thy thoughts, | but beware of two,--
POEM	All know what is known to three.
POEM	
POEM	64. The man who is prudent | a measured use
POEM	Of the might he has will make;
POEM	He finds when among | the brave he fares
POEM	That the boldest he may not be.
POEM	
POEM	65. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Oft for the words | that to others one speaks
POEM	He will get but an evil gift.
POEM	
POEM	66. Too early to many | a meeting I came,
POEM	And some too late have I sought;
POEM	The beer was all drunk, | or not yet brewed;
POEM	Little the loathed man finds.
POEM	
POEM	67. To their homes men would bid | me hither and yon,
POEM	If at meal-time I needed no meat,
POEM	Or would hang two hams | in my true friend's house,
POEM	Where only one I had eaten.
POEM	
POEM	68. Fire for men | is the fairest gift,
POEM	And power to see the sun;
POEM	Health as well, | if a man may have it,
POEM	And a life not stained with sin.
POEM	
POEM	69. All wretched is no man, | though never so sick;
POEM	Some from their sons have joy,
POEM	Some win it from kinsmen, | and some from their wealth,
POEM	And some from worthy works.
POEM	
POEM	70. It is better to live | than to lie a corpse,
POEM	The live man catches the cow;
POEM	I saw flames rise | for the rich man's pyre,
POEM	And before his door he lay dead.
POEM	
POEM	71. The lame rides a horse, | the handless is herdsman,
POEM	The deaf in battle is bold;
POEM	The blind man is better | than one that is burned,
POEM	No good can come of a corpse.
POEM	
POEM	72. A son is better, | though late he be born,
POEM	And his father to death have fared;
POEM	Memory-stones | seldom stand by the road
POEM	Save when kinsman honors his kin.
POEM	
POEM	73. Two make a battle, | the tongue slays the head;
POEM	In each furry coat | a fist I look for.
POEM	
POEM	74. He welcomes the night | whose fare is enough,
POEM	(Short are the yards of a ship,)
POEM	Uneasy are autumn nights;
POEM	Full oft does the weather | change in a week,
POEM	And more in a month's time.
POEM	
POEM	75. A man knows not, | if nothing he knows,
POEM	That gold oft apes begets;
POEM	One man is wealthy | and one is poor,
POEM	Yet scorn for him none should know.
POEM	
POEM	76. Among Fitjung's sons | saw I well-stocked folds,--
POEM	Now bear they the beggar's staff;
POEM	Wealth is as swift | as a winking eye,
POEM	Of friends the falsest it is.
POEM	
POEM	77. Cattle die, | and kinsmen die,
POEM	And so one dies one's self;
POEM	But a noble name | will never die,
POEM	If good renown one gets.
POEM	
POEM	78. Cattle die, | and kinsmen die,
POEM	And so one dies one's self;
POEM	One thing now | that never dies,
POEM	The fame of a dead man's deeds.
POEM	
POEM	79. Certain is that | which is sought from runes,
POEM	That the gods so great have made,
POEM	And the Master-Poet painted;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . of the race of gods:
POEM	Silence is safest and best.
POEM	
POEM	80. An unwise man, | if a maiden's love
POEM	Or wealth he chances to win,
POEM	His pride will wax, but his wisdom never,
POEM	Straight forward he fares in conceit.
POEM	* * *
POEM	
POEM	81. Give praise to the day at evening, | to a woman on her pyre,
POEM	To a weapon which is tried, | to a maid at wed lock,
POEM	To ice when it is crossed, | to ale that is drunk.
POEM	
POEM	82. When the gale blows hew wood, | in fair winds seek the water;
POEM	Sport with maidens at dusk, | for day's eyes are many;
POEM	From the ship seek swiftness, | from the shield protection,
POEM	Cuts from the sword, | from the maiden kisses.
POEM	
POEM	83. By the fire drink ale, | over ice go on skates;
POEM	Buy a steed that is lean, | and a sword when tarnished,
POEM	The horse at home fatten, | the hound in thy dwelling.
POEM	* * *
POEM	
POEM	84. A man shall trust not | the oath of a maid,
POEM	Nor the word a woman speaks;
POEM	For their hearts on a whirling | wheel were fashioned,
POEM	And fickle their breasts were formed.
POEM	
POEM	85. In a breaking bow | or a burning flame,
POEM	A ravening wolf | or a croaking raven,
POEM	In a grunting boar, | a tree with roots broken,
POEM	In billowy seas | or a bubbling kettle,
POEM	
POEM	86. In a flying arrow | or falling waters,
POEM	In ice new formed | or the serpent's folds,
POEM	In a bride's bed-speech | or a broken sword,
POEM	In the sport of bears | or in sons of kings,
POEM	
POEM	87. In a calf that is sick | or a stubborn thrall,
POEM	A flattering witch | or a foe new slain.
POEM	
POEM	88. In a brother's slayer, | if thou meet him abroad,
POEM	In a half-burned house, | in a horse full swift--
POEM	One leg is hurt | and the horse is useless--
POEM	None had ever such faith | as to trust in them all.
POEM	
POEM	89. Hope not too surely | for early harvest,
POEM	Nor trust too soon in thy son;
POEM	The field needs good weather, | the son needs wisdom,
POEM	And oft is either denied.
POEM	* * *
POEM	
POEM	90. The love of women | fickle of will
POEM	Is like starting o'er ice | with a steed unshod,
POEM	A two-year-old restive | and little tamed,
POEM	Or steering a rudderless | ship in a storm,
POEM	Or, lame, hunting reindeer | on slippery rocks.
POEM	* * *
POEM	
POEM	91. Clear now will I speak, | for I know them both,
POEM	Men false to women are found;
POEM	When fairest we speak, | then falsest we think,
POEM	Against wisdom we work with deceit.
POEM	
POEM	92. Soft words shall he speak | and wealth shall he offer
POEM	Who longs for a maiden's love,
POEM	And the beauty praise | of the maiden bright;
POEM	He wins whose wooing is best.
POEM	
POEM	93. Fault for loving | let no man find
POEM	Ever with any other;
POEM	Oft the wise are fettered, | where fools go free,
POEM	By beauty that breeds desire.
POEM	
POEM	94. Fault with another | let no man find
POEM	For what touches many a man;
POEM	Wise men oft | into witless fools
POEM	Are made by mighty love.
POEM	
POEM	95. The head alone knows | what dwells near the heart,
POEM	A man knows his mind alone;
POEM	No sickness is worse | to one who is wise
POEM	Than to lack the longed-for joy.
POEM	
POEM	96. This found I myself, | when I sat in the reeds,
POEM	And long my love awaited;
POEM	As my life the maiden | wise I loved,
POEM	Yet her I never had.
POEM	
POEM	97. Billing's daughter | I found on her bed,
POEM	In slumber bright as the sun;
POEM	Empty appeared | an earl's estate
POEM	Without that form so fair.
POEM	
POEM	98. "Othin, again | at evening come,
POEM	If a woman thou wouldst win;
POEM	Evil it were | if others than we
POEM	Should know of such a sin."
POEM	
POEM	99. Away I hastened, | hoping for joy,
POEM	And careless of counsel wise;
POEM	Well I believed | that soon I should win
POEM	Measureless joy with the maid.
POEM	
POEM	100. So came I next | when night it was,
POEM	The warriors all were awake;
POEM	With burning lights | and waving brands
POEM	I learned my luckess way.
POEM	
POEM	101. At morning then, | when once more I came,
POEM	And all were sleeping still,
POEM	A dog found | in the fair one's place,
POEM	Bound there upon her bed.
POEM	
POEM	102. Many fair maids, | if a man but tries them,
POEM	False to a lover are found;
POEM	That did I learn | when I longed to gain
POEM	With wiles the maiden wise;
POEM	Foul scorn was my meed | from the crafty maid,
POEM	And nought from the woman I won.
POEM	* * *
POEM	
POEM	103. Though glad at home, | and merry with guests,
POEM	A man shall be wary and wise;
POEM	The sage and shrewd, | wide wisdom seeking,
POEM	Must see that his speech be fair;
POEM	A fool is he named | who nought can say,
POEM	For such is the way of the witless.
POEM	
POEM	104. I found the old giant, | now back have I fared,
POEM	Small gain from silence I got;
POEM	Full many a word, | my will to get,
POEM	I spoke in Suttung's hall.
POEM	
POEM	105. The mouth of Rati | made room for my passage,
POEM	And space in the stone he gnawed;
POEM	Above and below | the giants' paths lay,
POEM	So rashly I risked my head.
POEM	
POEM	106. Gunnloth gave | on a golden stool
POEM	A drink of the marvelous mead;
POEM	A harsh reward | did I let her have
POEM	For her heroic heart,
POEM	And her spirit troubled sore.
POEM	
POEM	107. The well-earned beauty | well I enjoyed,
POEM	Little the wise man lacks;
POEM	So Othrörir now | has up been brought
POEM	To the midst of the men of earth.
POEM	
POEM	108. Hardly, methinks, | would I home have come,
POEM	And left the giants' land,
POEM	Had not Gunnloth helped me, | the maiden good,
POEM	Whose arms about me had been.
POEM	
POEM	109. The day that followed, | the frost-giants came,
POEM	Some word of Hor to win,
POEM	(And into the hall of Hor;)
POEM	Of Bolverk they asked, | were he back midst the gods,
POEM	Or had Suttung slain him there?
POEM	
POEM	110. On his ring swore Othin | the oath, methinks;
POEM	Who now his troth shall trust?
POEM	Suttung's betrayal | he sought with drink,
POEM	And Gunnloth to grief he left.
POEM	* * *
POEM	
POEM	111. It is time to chant | from the chanter's stool;
POEM	By the wells of Urth I was,
POEM	I saw and was silent, | I saw and thought,
POEM	And heard the speech of Hor.
POEM	(Of runes heard I words, | nor were counsels wanting,
POEM	At the hall of Hor,
POEM	In the hall of Hor;
POEM	Such was the speech I heard.)
POEM	
POEM	112. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,---
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	Rise not at night, | save if news thou seekest,
POEM	Or fain to the outhouse wouldst fare.
POEM	
POEM	113. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	Beware of sleep | on a witch's bosom,
POEM	Nor let her limbs ensnare thee.
POEM	
POEM	114. Such is her might | that thou hast no mind
POEM	For the council or meeting of men;
POEM	Meat thou hatest, | joy thou hast not,
POEM	And sadly to slumber thou farest.
POEM	
POEM	115. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	Seek never to win | the wife of another,
POEM	Or long for her secret love.
POEM	
POEM	116. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	If o'er mountains or gulfs | thou fain wouldst go,
POEM	Look well to thy food for the way.
POEM	
POEM	117. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	An evil man | thou must not let
POEM	Bring aught of ill to thee;
POEM	For an evil man | will never make
POEM	Reward for a worthy thought.
POEM	
POEM	118. I saw a man | who was wounded sore
POEM	By an evil woman's word;
POEM	A lying tongue | his death-blow launched,
POEM	And no word of truth there was.
POEM	
POEM	119. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	If a friend thou hast | whom thou fully wilt trust,
POEM	Then fare to find him oft;
POEM	For brambles grow | and waving grass
POEM	On the rarely trodden road.
POEM	
POEM	120. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	A good man find | to hold in friendship,
POEM	And give heed to his healing charms.
POEM	
POEM	121. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	Be never the first | to break with thy friend
POEM	The bond that holds you both;
POEM	Care eats the heart | if thou canst not speak
POEM	To another all thy thought.
POEM	
POEM	122. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	Exchange of words | with a witless ape
POEM	Thou must not ever make.
POEM	
POEM	123. For never thou mayst | from an evil man
POEM	A good requital get;
POEM	But a good man oft | the greatest love
POEM	Through words of praise will win thee.
POEM	
POEM	124. Mingled is love | when a man can speak
POEM	To another all his thought;
POEM	Nought is so bad | as false to be,
POEM	No friend speaks only fair.
POEM	
POEM	125. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	With a worse man speak not | three words in dispute,
POEM	Ill fares the better oft
POEM	When the worse man wields a sword.
POEM	
POEM	126. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	A shoemaker be, | or a maker of shafts,
POEM	For only thy single self;
POEM	If the shoe is ill made, | or the shaft prove false,
POEM	Then evil of thee men think.
POEM	
POEM	127. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	If evil thou knowest, | as evil proclaim it,
POEM	And make no friendship with foes.
POEM	
POEM	128. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	In evil never | joy shalt thou know,
POEM	But glad the good shall make thee.
POEM	
POEM	129. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	Look not up | when the battle is on,--
POEM	(Like madmen the sons | of men become,--)
POEM	Lest men bewitch thy wits.
POEM	
POEM	130. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	If thou fain wouldst win | a woman's love,
POEM	And gladness get from her,
POEM	Fair be thy promise | and well fulfilled;
POEM	None loathes what good he gets.
POEM	
POEM	131. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	I bid thee be wary, | but be not fearful;
POEM	(Beware most with ale or another's wife,
POEM	And third beware | lest a thief outwit thee.)
POEM	
POEM	132. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	Scorn or mocking | ne'er shalt thou make
POEM	Of a guest or a journey-goer.
POEM	
POEM	133. Oft scarcely he knows | who sits in the house
POEM	What kind is the man who comes;
POEM	None so good is found | that faults he has not,
POEM	Nor so wicked that nought he is worth.
POEM	
POEM	134. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	Scorn not ever | the gray-haired singer,
POEM	Oft do the old speak good;
POEM	(Oft from shrivelled skin | come skillful counsels,
POEM	Though it hang with the hides,
POEM	And flap with the pelts,
POEM	And is blown with the bellies.)
POEM	
POEM	135. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	Curse not thy guest, | nor show him thy gate,
POEM	Deal well with a man in want.
POEM	
POEM	136. Strong is the beam | that raised must be
POEM	To give an entrance to all;
POEM	Give it a ring, | or grim will be
POEM	The wish it would work on thee.
POEM	
POEM	137. I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--
POEM	Profit thou hast if thou hearest,
POEM	Great thy gain if thou learnest:
POEM	When ale thou drinkest) | seek might of earth,
POEM	(For earth cures drink, | and fire cures ills,
POEM	The oak cures tightness, | the ear cures magic,
POEM	Rye cures rupture, | the moon cures rage,
POEM	Grass cures the scab, | and runes the sword-cut;)
POEM	The field absorbs the flood.
POEM	
POEM	138. Now are Hor's words | spoken in the hall,
POEM	Kind for the kindred of men,
POEM	Cursed for the kindred of giants:
POEM	Hail to the speaker, | and to him who learns!
POEM	Profit be his who has them!
POEM	Hail to them who hearken!
POEM	* * *
POEM	
POEM	139. I ween that I hung | on the windy tree,
POEM	Hung there for nights full nine;
POEM	With the spear I was wounded, | and offered I was
POEM	To Othin, myself to myself,
POEM	On the tree that none | may ever know
POEM	What root beneath it runs.
POEM	
POEM	140. None made me happy | with loaf or horn,
POEM	And there below I looked;
POEM	I took up the runes, | shrieking I took them,
POEM	And forthwith back I fell.
POEM	
POEM	141. Nine mighty songs | I got from the son
POEM	Of Bolthorn, Bestla's father;
POEM	And a drink I got | of the goodly mead
POEM	Poured out from Othrörir.
POEM	
POEM	142. Then began I to thrive, | and wisdom to get,
POEM	I grew and well I was;
POEM	Each word led me on | to another word,
POEM	Each deed to another deed.
POEM	
POEM	143. Runes shalt thou find, | and fateful signs,
POEM	That the king of singers colored,
POEM	And the mighty gods have made;
POEM	Full strong the signs, | full mighty the signs
POEM	That the ruler of gods doth write.
POEM	
POEM	144. Othin for the gods, | Dain for the elves,
POEM	And Dvalin for the dwarfs,
POEM	Alsvith for giants | and all mankind,
POEM	And some myself I wrote.
POEM	
POEM	145. Knowest how one shall write, | knowest how one shall rede?
POEM	Knowest how one shall tint, | knowest how one makes trial?
POEM	Knowest how one shall ask, | knowest how one shall offer?
POEM	Knowest how one shall send, | knowest how one shall sacrifice?
POEM	
POEM	146. Better no prayer | than too big an offering,
POEM	By thy getting measure thy gift;
POEM	Better is none | than too big a sacrifice,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	So Thund of old wrote | ere man's race began,
POEM	Where he rose on high | when home he came.
POEM	* * *
POEM	
POEM	147. The songs I know | that king's wives know not,
POEM	Nor men that are sons of men;
POEM	The first is called help, | and help it can bring thee
POEM	In sorrow and pain and sickness.
POEM	
POEM	148. A second I know, | that men shall need
POEM	Who leechcraft long to use;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	149. A third I know, | if great is my need
POEM	Of fetters to hold my foe;
POEM	Blunt do I make | mine enemy's blade,
POEM	Nor bites his sword or staff.
POEM	
POEM	150. A fourth I know, | if men shall fasten
POEM	Bonds on my bended legs;
POEM	So great is the charm | that forth I may go,
POEM	The fetters spring from my feet,
POEM	Broken the bonds from my hands.
POEM	
POEM	152. A fifth I know, | if I see from afar
POEM	An arrow fly 'gainst the folk;
POEM	It flies not so swift | that I stop it not,
POEM	If ever my eyes behold it.
POEM	
POEM	152. A sixth I know, | if harm one seeks
POEM	With a sapling's roots to send me;
POEM	The hero himself | who wreaks his hate
POEM	Shall taste the ill ere I.
POEM	
POEM	153. A seventh I know, | if I see in flames
POEM	The hall o'er my comrades' heads;
POEM	It burns not so wide | that I will not quench it,
POEM	I know that song to sing.
POEM	
POEM	154. An eighth I know, | that is to all
POEM	Of greatest good to learn;
POEM	When hatred grows | among heroes' sons,
POEM	I soon can set it right.
POEM	
POEM	155. A ninth I know, | if need there comes
POEM	To shelter my ship on the flood;
POEM	The wind I calm | upon the waves,
POEM	And the sea I put to sleep.
POEM	
POEM	156. A tenth I know, | what time I see
POEM	House-riders flying on high;
POEM	So can I work | that wildly they go,
POEM	Showing their true shapes,
POEM	Hence to their own homes.
POEM	
POEM	157. An eleventh I know, | if needs I must lead
POEM	To the fight my long-loved friends;
POEM	I sing in the shields, | and in strength they go
POEM	Whole to the field of fight,
POEM	Whole from the field of fight,
POEM	And whole they come thence home.
POEM	
POEM	158. A twelfth I know, | if high on a tree
POEM	I see a hanged man swing;
POEM	So do I write | and color the runes
POEM	That forth he fares,
POEM	And to me talks.
POEM	
POEM	159. A thirteenth I know, | if a thane full young
POEM	With water I sprinkle well;
POEM	He shall not fall, | though he fares mid the host,
POEM	Nor sink beneath the swords.
POEM	
POEM	160. A fourteenth I know, | if fain I would name
POEM	To men the mighty gods;
POEM	All know I well | of the gods and elves,
POEM	Few be the fools know this.
POEM	
POEM	161. A fifteenth I know, | that before the doors
POEM	Of Delling sang Thjothrörir the dwarf;
POEM	Might he sang for the gods, | and glory for elves,
POEM	And wisdom for Hroptatyr wise.
POEM	
POEM	162. A sixteenth I know, | if I seek delight
POEM	To win from a maiden wise;
POEM	The mind I turn | of the white-armed maid,
POEM	And thus change all her thoughts.
POEM	
POEM	163. A seventeenth I know, | so that seldom shall go
POEM	A maiden young from me;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	164. Long these songs | thou shalt, Loddfafnir,
POEM	Seek in vain to sing;
POEM	Yet good it were | if thou mightest get them,
POEM	Well, if thou wouldst them learn,
POEM	Help, if thou hadst them.
POEM	
POEM	165. An eighteenth I know, | that ne'er will I tell
POEM	To maiden or wife of man,--
POEM	The best is what none | but one's self doth know,
POEM	So comes the end of the songs,--
POEM	Save only to her | in whose arms I lie,
POEM	Or who else my sister is.
TITLE	VAFTHRUTHNISMOL
SUBTITLE	The Ballad of Vafthruthnir
POEM	1. "Counsel me, Frigg, for I long to fare,
POEM	And Vafthruthnir fain would find;
POEM	fit wisdom old with the giant wise
POEM	Myself would I seek to match."
POEM	
POEM	Frigg spake:
POEM	2. "Heerfather here at home would I keep,
POEM	Where the gods together dwell;
POEM	Amid all the giants an equal in might
POEM	To Vafthruthnir know I none."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	3. "Much have I fared, much have I found.
POEM	Much have I got from the gods;
POEM	And fain would I know how Vafthruthnir now
POEM	Lives in his lofty hall."
POEM	
POEM	Frigg spake:
POEM	4. "Safe mayst thou go, safe come again,
POEM	And safe be the way thou wendest!
POEM	Father of men, let thy mind be keen
POEM	When speech with the giant thou seekest."
POEM	
POEM	5. The wisdom then of the giant wise
POEM	Forth did he fare to try;
POEM	He found the hall | of the father of Im,
POEM	And in forthwith went Ygg.
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	6. "Vafthruthnir, hail! | to thy hall am I come,
POEM	For thyself I fain would see;
POEM	And first would I ask | if wise thou art,
POEM	Or, giant, all wisdom hast won."
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	7. "Who is the man | that speaks to me,
POEM	Here in my lofty hall?
POEM	Forth from our dwelling | thou never shalt fare,
POEM	Unless wiser than I thou art."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	8. "Gagnrath they call me, | and thirsty I come
POEM	From a journey hard to thy hall;
POEM	Welcome I look for, | for long have I fared,
POEM	And gentle greeting, giant."
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	9. "Why standest thou there | on the floor whilst thou speakest?
POEM	A seat shalt thou have in my hall;
POEM	Then soon shall we know | whose knowledge is more,
POEM	The guest's or the sage's gray."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	10. "If a poor man reaches | the home of the rich,
POEM	Let him wisely speak or be still;
POEM	For to him who speaks | with the hard of heart
POEM	Will chattering ever work ill."
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	11. "Speak forth now, Gagnrath, | if there from the floor
POEM	Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known:
POEM	What name has the steed | that each morn anew
POEM	The day for mankind doth draw?"
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	12. "Skinfaxi is he, | the steed who for men
POEM	The glittering day doth draw;
POEM	The best of horses | to heroes he seems,
POEM	And brightly his mane doth burn."
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	13. "Speak forth now, Gagnrath, | if there from the floor
POEM	Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known:
POEM	What name has the steed | that from East anew
POEM	Brings night for the noble gods?"
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	14. "Hrimfaxi name they | the steed that anew
POEM	Brings night for the noble gods;
POEM	Each morning foam | from his bit there falls,
POEM	And thence come the dews in the dales."
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	15. "Speak forth now, Gagnrath, | if there from the floor
POEM	Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known:
POEM	What name has the river | that 'twixt the realms
POEM	Of the gods and the giants goes?"
POEM	Othin spoke:
POEM	
POEM	16. "Ifing is the river | that 'twixt the realms
POEM	Of the gods and the giants goes;
POEM	For all time ever | open it flows,
POEM	No ice on the river there is."
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	17. "Speak forth now, Gagnrath, | if there from the floor
POEM	Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known:
POEM	What name has the field | where in fight shall meet
POEM	Surt and the gracious gods?"
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	18. "Vigrith is the field | where in fight shall meet
POEM	Surt and the gracious gods;
POEM	A hundred miles | each way does it measure.
POEM	And so are its boundaries set."
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	19. "Wise art thou, guest! | To my bench shalt thou go,
POEM	In our seats let us speak together;
POEM	Here in the hall | our heads, O guest,
POEM	Shall we wager our wisdom upon."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	20. "First answer me well, | if thy wisdom avails,
POEM	And thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:
POEM	In earliest time | whence came the earth,
POEM	Or the sky, thou giant sage?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	21. "Out of Ymir's flesh | was fashioned the earth,
POEM	And the mountains were made of his bones;
POEM	The sky from the frost-cold | giant's skull,
POEM	And the ocean out of his blood."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	22. "Next answer me well, | if thy wisdom avails,
POEM	And thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:
POEM	Whence came the moon, | o'er the world of men
POEM	That fares, and the flaming sun?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	23. "Mundilferi is he | who begat the moon,
POEM	And fathered the flaming sun;
POEM	The round of heaven | each day they run,
POEM	To tell the time for men."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	24. "Third answer me well, | if wise thou art called,
POEM	If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:
POEM	Whence came the day, | o'er mankind that fares,
POEM	Or night with the narrowing moon?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	25. "The father of day | is Delling called,
POEM	And the night was begotten by Nor;
POEM	Full moon and old | by the gods were fashioned,
POEM	To tell the time for men."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	26. "Fourth answer me well, | if wise thou art called,
POEM	If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:
POEM	Whence did winter come, | or the summer warm,
POEM	First with the gracious gods?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	27. "Vindsval he was | who was winter's father,
POEM	And Svosuth summer begat;"
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	28. "Fifth answer me well, | if wise thou art called,
POEM	If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:
POEM	What giant first | was fashioned of old,
POEM	And the eldest of Ymir's kin?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	29. "Winters unmeasured | ere earth was made
POEM	Was the birth of Bergelmir;
POEM	Thruthgelmir's son | was the giant strong,
POEM	And Aurgelmir's grandson of old."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	30. "Sixth answer me well, | if wise thou art called,
POEM	If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:
POEM	Whence did Aurgelmir come | with the giants' kin,
POEM	Long since, thou giant sage?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	31. "Down from Elivagar | did venom drop,
POEM	And waxed till a giant it was;
POEM	And thence arose | our giants' race,
POEM	And thus so fierce are we found."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	32. "Seventh answer me well, | if wise thou art called,
POEM	If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:
POEM	How begat he children, | the giant grim,
POEM	Who never a giantess knew?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	33. "They say 'neath the arms | of the giant of ice
POEM	Grew man-child and maid together;
POEM	And foot with foot | did the wise one fashion
POEM	A son that six heads bore."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	34. "Eighth answer me well, | if wise thou art called,
POEM	If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:
POEM	What farthest back | dost thou bear in mind?
POEM	For wide is thy wisdom, giant!"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	35. "Winters unmeasured | ere earth was made
POEM	Was the birth of Bergelmir;
POEM	This first knew I well, | when the giant wise
POEM	In a boat of old was borne."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	36. "Ninth answer me well, | if wise thou art called
POEM	If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:
POEM	Whence comes the wind | that fares o'er the waves
POEM	Yet never itself is seen?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	37. "In an eagle's guise | at the end of heaven
POEM	Hræsvelg sits, they say;
POEM	And from his wings | does the wind come forth
POEM	To move o'er the world of men."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	38. "Tenth answer me now, | if thou knowest all
POEM	The fate that is fixed for the gods:
POEM	Whence came up Njorth | to the kin of the gods,--
POEM	(Rich in temples | and shrines he rules,--)
POEM	Though of gods he was never begot?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	39. "In the home of the Wanes | did the wise ones create him,
POEM	And gave him as pledge to the gods;
POEM	At the fall of the world | shall he fare once more
POEM	Home to the Wanes so wise."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	40. "Eleventh answer me well, | . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	What men . . . . . . | in . . . . . . home
POEM	Each day to fight go forth?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	41. "The heroes all | in Othin's hall
POEM	Each day to fight go forth;
POEM	They fell each other, | and fare from the fight
POEM	All healed full soon to sit."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	42. "Twelfth answer me now | how all thou knowest
POEM	Of the fate that is fixed for the gods;
POEM	Of the runes of the gods | and the giants' race
POEM	The truth indeed dost thou tell,
POEM	(And wide is thy wisdom, giant!)"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	43. "Of the runes of the gods | and the giants' race
POEM	The truth indeed can I tell,
POEM	(For to every world have I won;)
POEM	To nine worlds came I, | to Niflhel beneath,
POEM	The home where dead men dwell."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	44. "Much have I fared, | much have I found,
POEM	Much have I got of the gods:
POEM	What shall live of mankind | when at last there comes
POEM	The mighty winter to men?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	45. "In Hoddmimir's wood | shall hide themselves
POEM	Lif and Lifthrasir then;
POEM	The morning dews | for meat shall they have,
POEM	Such food shall men then find."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	46. "Much have I fared, | much have I found,
POEM	Much have I got of the gods:
POEM	Whence comes the sun | to the smooth sky back,
POEM	When Fenrir has snatched it forth?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	47. "A daughter bright | Alfrothul bears
POEM	Ere Fenrir snatches her forth;
POEM	Her mother's paths | shall the maiden tread
POEM	When the gods to death have gone."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	48. "Much have I fared, | much have I found,
POEM	Much have I got of the gods:
POEM	What maidens are they, | so wise of mind.
POEM	That forth o'er the sea shall fare?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	49. "O'er Mogthrasir's hill | shall the maidens pass,
POEM	And three are their throngs that come;
POEM	They all shall protect | the dwellers on earth,
POEM	Though they come of the giants' kin."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	50. "Much have I fared, | much have I found,
POEM	Much have I got of the gods:
POEM	Who then shall rule | the realm of the gods,
POEM	When the fires of Surt have sunk?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	51. "In the gods' home Vithar | and Vali shall dwell,
POEM	When the fires of Surt have sunk;
POEM	Mothi and Magni | shall Mjollnir have
POEM	When Vingnir falls in fight."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	52. "Much have I fared, | much have I found,
POEM	Much have I got of the gods:
POEM	What shall bring the doom | of death to Othin,
POEM	When the gods to destruction go?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	53. "The wolf shall fell | the father of men,
POEM	And this shall Vithar avenge;
POEM	The terrible jaws | shall he tear apart,
POEM	And so the wolf shall he slay."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	54. "Much have I fared, | much have I found,
POEM	Much have I got from the gods:
POEM	What spake Othin himself | in the ears of his son,
POEM	Ere in the bale-fire he burned?"
POEM	
POEM	Vafthruthnir spake:
POEM	55. "No man can tell | what in olden time
POEM	Thou spak'st in the ears of thy son;
POEM	With fated mouth | the fall of the gods
POEM	And mine olden tales have I told;
POEM	With Othin in knowledge | now have I striven,
POEM	And ever the wiser thou art."
TITLE	GRIMNISMOL
SUBTITLE	The Ballad of Grimnir
POEM	1. Hot art thou, fire! | too fierce by far;
POEM	Get ye now gone, ye flames!
POEM	The mantle is burnt, | though I bear it aloft,
POEM	And the fire scorches the fur.
POEM	
POEM	2. 'Twixt the fires now | eight nights have I sat,
POEM	And no man brought meat to me,
POEM	Save Agnar alone, | and alone shall rule
POEM	Geirröth's son o'er the Goths.
POEM	
POEM	3. Hail to thee, Agnar! | for hailed thou art
POEM	By the voice of Veratyr;
POEM	For a single drink | shalt thou never receive
POEM	A greater gift as reward.
POEM	
POEM	4. The land is holy | that lies hard by
POEM	The gods and the elves together;
POEM	And Thor shall ever | in Thruthheim dwell,
POEM	Till the gods to destruction go.
POEM	
POEM	5. Ydalir call they | the place where Ull
POEM	A hall for himself hath set;
POEM	And Alfheim the gods | to Freyr once gave
POEM	As a tooth-gift in ancient times.
POEM	
POEM	6. A third home is there, | with silver thatched
POEM	By the hands of the gracious gods:
POEM	Valaskjolf is it, | in days of old
POEM	Set by a god for himself.
POEM	
POEM	7. Sökkvabekk is the fourth, | where cool waves flow,
POEM	And amid their murmur it stands;
POEM	There daily do Othin | and Saga drink
POEM	In gladness from cups of gold.
POEM	
POEM	8. The fifth is Glathsheim, | and gold-bright there
POEM	Stands Valhall stretching wide;
POEM	And there does Othin | each day choose
POEM	The men who have fallen in fight.
POEM	
POEM	9. Easy is it to know | for him who to Othin
POEM	Comes and beholds the hall;
POEM	Its rafters are spears, | with shields is it roofed,
POEM	On its benches are breastplates strewn.
POEM	
POEM	10. Easy is it to know | for him who to Othin
POEM	Comes and beholds the hall;
POEM	There hangs a wolf | by the western door,
POEM	And o'er it an eagle hovers.
POEM	
POEM	11. The sixth is Thrymheim, | where Thjazi dwelt,
POEM	The giant of marvelous might;
POEM	Now Skathi abides, | the god's fair bride,
POEM	In the home that her father had.
POEM	
POEM	12. The seventh is Breithablik; | Baldr has there
POEM	For himself a dwelling set,
POEM	In the land I know | that lies so fair,
POEM	And from evil fate is free.
POEM	
POEM	13. Himinbjorg is the eighth, | and Heimdall there
POEM	O'er men holds sway, it is said;
POEM	In his well-built house | does the warder of heaven
POEM	The good mead gladly drink.
POEM	
POEM	14. The ninth is Folkvang, | where Freyja decrees
POEM	Who shall have seats in the hall;
POEM	The half of the dead | each day does she choose,
POEM	And half does Othin have.
POEM	
POEM	15. The tenth is Glitnir; | its pillars are gold,
POEM	And its roof with silver is set;
POEM	There most of his days | does Forseti dwell,
POEM	And sets all strife at end.
POEM	
POEM	16. The eleventh is Noatun; | there has Njorth
POEM	For himself a dwelling set;
POEM	The sinless ruler | of men there sits
POEM	In his temple timbered high.
POEM	
POEM	17. Filled with growing trees | and high-standing grass
POEM	Is Vithi, Vithar's land;
POEM	But there did the son | from his steed leap down,
POEM	When his father he fain would avenge.
POEM	
POEM	18. In Eldhrimnir | Andhrimnir cooks
POEM	Sæhrimnir's seething flesh,--
POEM	The best of food, | but few men know
POEM	On what fare the warriors feast.
POEM	
POEM	19. Freki and Geri | does Heerfather feed,
POEM	The far-famed fighter of old:
POEM	But on wine alone | does the weapon-decked god,
POEM	Othin, forever live.
POEM	
POEM	20. O'er Mithgarth Hugin | and Munin both
POEM	Each day set forth to fly;
POEM	For Hugin I fear | lest he come not home,
POEM	But for Munin my care is more.
POEM	
POEM	21. Loud roars Thund, | and Thjothvitnir's fish
POEM	joyously fares in the flood;
POEM	Hard does it seem | to the host of the slain
POEM	To wade the torrent wild.
POEM	
POEM	22. There Valgrind stands, | the sacred gate,
POEM	And behind are the holy doors;
POEM	Old is the gate, | but few there are
POEM	Who can tell how it tightly is locked.
POEM	
POEM	23. Five hundred doors | and forty there are,
POEM	I ween, in Valhall's walls;
POEM	Eight hundred fighters | through one door fare
POEM	When to war with the wolf they go.
POEM	
POEM	24. Five hundred rooms | and forty there are
POEM	I ween, in Bilskirnir built;
POEM	Of all the homes | whose roofs I beheld,
POEM	My son's the greatest meseemed.
POEM	
POEM	25. Heithrun is the goat | who stands by Heerfather's hall,
POEM	And the branches of Lærath she bites;
POEM	The pitcher she fills | with the fair, clear mead,
POEM	Ne'er fails the foaming drink.
POEM	
POEM	26. Eikthyrnir is the hart | who stands by Heerfather's hall
POEM	And the branches of Lærath he bites;
POEM	From his horns a stream | into Hvergelmir drops,
POEM	Thence all the rivers run.
POEM	
POEM	27. Sith and Vith, | Sækin and Ækin,
POEM	Svol and Fimbulthul, | Gunnthro, and Fjorm,
POEM	Rin and Rinnandi,
POEM	Gipul and Gopul, | Gomul and Geirvimul,
POEM	That flow through the fields of the gods;
POEM	Thyn and Vin, | Thol and Hol,
POEM	Groth and Gunnthorin.
POEM	
POEM	28. Vino is one, | Vegsvin another,
POEM	And Thjothnuma a third;
POEM	Nyt and Not, | Non and Hron,
POEM	Slith and Hrith, | Sylg and Ylg,
POEM	Vith and Von, | Vond and Strond,
POEM	Gjol and Leipt, | that go among men,
POEM	And hence they fall to Hel.
POEM	
POEM	29. Kormt and Ormt | and the Kerlaugs twain
POEM	Shall Thor each day wade through,
POEM	(When dooms to give | he forth shall go
POEM	To the ash-tree Yggdrasil;)
POEM	For heaven's bridge | burns all in flame,
POEM	And the sacred waters seethe.
POEM	
POEM	30. Glath and Gyllir, | Gler and Skeithbrimir,
POEM	Silfrintopp and Sinir,
POEM	Gisl and Falhofnir, | Golltopp and Lettfeti,
POEM	On these steeds the gods shall go
POEM	When dooms to give | each day they ride
POEM	To the ash-tree Yggdrasil.
POEM	
POEM	31. Three roots there are | that three ways run
POEM	Neath the ash-tree Yggdrasil;
POEM	Neath the first lives Hel, | 'neath the second the frost-giants,
POEM	Neath the last are the lands of men.
POEM	
POEM	32. Ratatosk is the squirrel | who there shall run
POEM	On the ash-tree Yggdrasil;
POEM	From above the words | of the eagle he bears,
POEM	And tells them to Nithhogg beneath.
POEM	
POEM	33. Four harts there are, | that the highest twigs
POEM	Nibble with necks bent back;
POEM	Dain and Dvalin, | . . . . . .
POEM	Duneyr and Dyrathror.
POEM	
POEM	34. More serpents there are | beneath the ash
POEM	Than an unwise ape would think;
POEM	Goin and Moin, | Grafvitnir's sons,
POEM	Grabak and Grafvolluth,
POEM	Ofnir and Svafnir | shall ever, methinks,
POEM	Gnaw at the twigs of the tree.
POEM	
POEM	35. Yggdrasil's ash | great evil suffers,
POEM	Far more than men do know;
POEM	The hart bites its top, | its trunk is rotting,
POEM	And Nithhogg gnaws beneath.
POEM	
POEM	36. Hrist and Mist | bring the horn at my will,
POEM	Skeggjold and Skogul;
POEM	Hild and Thruth, | Hlok and Herfjotur,
POEM	Gol and Geironul,
POEM	Randgrith and Rathgrith | and Reginleif
POEM	Beer to the warriors bring.
POEM	
POEM	37. Arvak and Alsvith | up shall drag
POEM	Weary the weight of the sun;
POEM	But an iron cool | have the kindly gods
POEM	Of yore set under their yokes.
POEM	
POEM	38. In front of the sun | does Svalin stand,
POEM	The shield for the shining god;
POEM	Mountains and sea | would be set in flames
POEM	If it fell from before the sun.
POEM	
POEM	39. Skoll is the wolf | that to Ironwood
POEM	Follows the glittering god,
POEM	And the son of Hrothvitnir, | Hati, awaits
POEM	The burning bride of heaven.
POEM	
POEM	40. Out of Ymir's flesh | was fashioned the earth,
POEM	And the ocean out of his blood;
POEM	Of his bones the hills, | of his hair the trees,
POEM	Of his skull the heavens high.
POEM	
POEM	41. Mithgarth the gods | from his eyebrows made,
POEM	And set for the sons of men;
POEM	And out of his brain | the baleful clouds
POEM	They made to move on high.
POEM	
POEM	42. His the favor of Ull | and of all the gods
POEM	Who first in the flames will reach;
POEM	For the house can be seen | by the sons of the gods
POEM	If the kettle aside were cast.
POEM	
POEM	43. In days of old | did Ivaldi's sons
POEM	Skithblathnir fashion fair,
POEM	The best of ships | for the bright god Freyr,
POEM	The noble son of Njorth.
POEM	
POEM	44. The best of trees | must Yggdrasil be,
POEM	Skithblathnir best of boats;
POEM	Of all the gods | is Othin the greatest,
POEM	And Sleipnir the best of steeds;
POEM	Bifrost of bridges, | Bragi of skalds,
POEM	Hobrok of hawks, | and Garm of hounds.
POEM	
POEM	45. To the race of the gods | my face have I raised,
POEM	And the wished-for aid have I waked;
POEM	For to all the gods | has the message gone
POEM	That sit in Ægir's seats,
POEM	That drink within Ægir's doors.
POEM	
POEM	46. Grim is my name, | Gangleri am 1,
POEM	Herjan and Hjalmberi,
POEM	Thekk and Thrithi, | Thuth and Uth,
POEM	Helblindi and Hor;
POEM	
POEM	47. Sath and Svipal | and Sanngetal,
POEM	Herteit and Hnikar,
POEM	Bileyg, Baleyg, | Bolverk, Fjolnir,
POEM	Grim and Grimnir, | Glapsvith, Fjolsvith.
POEM	
POEM	48. Sithhott, Sithskegg, | Sigfather, Hnikuth,
POEM	Allfather, Valfather, | Atrith, Farmatyr:
POEM	A single name | have I never had
POEM	Since first among men I fared.
POEM	
POEM	49. Grimnir they call me | in Geirröth's hall,
POEM	With Asmund Jalk am I;
POEM	Kjalar I was | when I went in a sledge,
POEM	At the council Thror am I called,
POEM	As Vithur I fare to the fight;
POEM	Oski, Biflindi, | Jafnhor and Omi,
POEM	Gondlir and Harbarth midst gods.
POEM	So. I deceived the giant | Sokkmimir old
POEM	As Svithur and Svithrir of yore;
POEM	Of Mithvitnir's son | the slayer I was
POEM	When the famed one found his doom.
POEM	
POEM	51. Drunk art thou, Geirröth, | too much didst thou drink,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Much hast thou lost, | for help no more
POEM	From me or my heroes thou hast.
POEM	
POEM	52. Small heed didst thou take | to all that I told,
POEM	And false were the words of thy friends;
POEM	For now the sword | of my friend I see,
POEM	That waits all wet with blood.
POEM	
POEM	53. Thy sword-pierced body | shall Ygg have soon,
POEM	For thy life is ended at last;
POEM	The maids are hostile; | now Othin behold!
POEM	Now come to me if thou canst!
POEM	
POEM	54. Now am I Othin, | Ygg was I once,
POEM	Ere that did they call me Thund;
POEM	Vak and Skilfing, | Vofuth and Hroptatyr,
POEM	Gaut and Jalk midst the gods;
POEM	Ofnir and Svafnir, | and all, methinks,
POEM	Are names for none but me.
POEM	King Geirröth sat and had his sword on his knee, half drawn from its sheath. But when he heard that
POEM	Othin was come thither, then he rose up and sought to take Othin from the fire. The sword slipped from
POEM	his hand, and fell with the hilt down. The king stumbled and fell forward, and the sword pierced him
POEM	through, and slew him. Then Othin vanished, but Agnar long ruled there as king.

POEM	1. "Go now, Skirnir! | and seek to gain
POEM	Speech from my son;
POEM	And answer to win, | for whom the wise one
POEM	Is mightily moved."
POEM	
POEM	Skirnir spake:
POEM	2. "Ill words do I now | await from thy son,
POEM	If I seek to get speech with him,
POEM	And answer to win, | for whom the wise one
POEM	Is mightily moved."
POEM	
POEM	Skirnir spake:
POEM	3. "Speak prithee, Freyr, | foremost of the gods,
POEM	For now I fain would know;
POEM	Why sittest thou here | in the wide halls,
POEM	Days long, my prince, alone?"
POEM	
POEM	Freyr spake:
POEM	4. "How shall I tell thee, | thou hero young,
POEM	Of all my grief so great?
POEM	Though every day | the elfbeam dawns,
POEM	It lights my longing never."
POEM	
POEM	Skirnir spake:
POEM	5. "Thy longings, methinks, | are not so large
POEM	That thou mayst not tell them to me;
POEM	Since in days of yore | we were young together,
POEM	We two might each other trust."
POEM	
POEM	Freyr spake:
POEM	6. "From Gymir's house | I beheld go forth
POEM	A maiden dear to me;
POEM	Her arms glittered, | and from their gleam
POEM	Shone all the sea and sky.
POEM	
POEM	7. "To me more dear | than in days of old
POEM	Was ever maiden to man;
POEM	But no one of gods | or elves will grant
POEM	That we both together should be."
POEM	
POEM	Skirnir spake:
POEM	8. "Then give me the horse | that goes through the dark
POEM	And magic flickering flames;
POEM	And the sword as well | that fights of itself
POEM	Against the giants grim."
POEM	
POEM	Freyr spake:
POEM	9. "The horse will I give thee | that goes through the dark
POEM	And magic flickering flames,
POEM	And the sword as well | that will fight of itself
POEM	If a worthy hero wields it."
POEM	
POEM	Skirnir spake to the horse:
POEM	10. "Dark is it without, | and I deem it time
POEM	To fare through the wild fells,
POEM	(To fare through the giants' fastness;)
POEM	We shall both come back, | or us both together
POEM	The terrible giant will take."
POEM	Skirnir rode into Jotunheim to Gymir's house. There were fierce dogs bound before the gate of the fence
POEM	which was around Gerth's hall. He rode to where a herdsman sat on a hill, and said:
POEM	
POEM	11. "Tell me, herdsman, | sitting on the hill,
POEM	And watching all the ways,
POEM	How may I win | a word with the maid
POEM	Past the hounds of Gymir here?"
POEM	
POEM	The herdsman spake:
POEM	12. "Art thou doomed to die | or already dead,
POEM	Thou horseman that ridest hither?
POEM	Barred from speech | shalt thou ever be
POEM	With Gymir's daughter good."
POEM	
POEM	Skirnir spake:
POEM	13. "Boldness is better | than plaints can be
POEM	For him whose feet must fare;
POEM	To a destined day has mine age been doomed,
POEM	And my life's span thereto laid."
POEM	
POEM	Gerth spake:
POEM	14. "What noise is that which now so loud
POEM	I hear within our house?
POEM	The ground shakes, and the home of Gymir
POEM	Around me trembles too."
POEM	
POEM	The Serving-Maid spake:
POEM	15. "One stands without who has leapt from his steed,
POEM	And lets his horse loose to graze;"
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	Gerth spake:
POEM	16. "Bid the man come in, and drink good mead
POEM	Here within our hall;
POEM	Though this I fear, that there without
POEM	My brother's slayer stands.
POEM	
POEM	17. "Art thou of the elves | or the offspring of gods,
POEM	Or of the wise Wanes?
POEM	How camst thou alone | through the leaping flame
POEM	Thus to behold our home?"
POEM	
POEM	Skirnir spake:
POEM	18. "I am not of the elves, | nor the offspring of gods,
POEM	Nor of the wise Wanes;
POEM	Though I came alone | through the leaping flame
POEM	Thus to behold thy home.
POEM	
POEM	19. "Eleven apples, | all of gold,
POEM	Here will I give thee, Gerth,
POEM	To buy thy troth | that Freyr shall be
POEM	Deemed to be dearest to you."
POEM	
POEM	Gerth spake:
POEM	20. "I will not take | at any man's wish
POEM	These eleven apples ever;
POEM	Nor shall Freyr and I | one dwelling find
POEM	So long as we two live."
POEM	
POEM	Skirnir spake:
POEM	21. "Then do I bring thee | the ring that was burned
POEM	Of old with Othin's son;
POEM	From it do eight | of like weight fall
POEM	On every ninth night."
POEM	
POEM	Gerth spake:
POEM	22. "The ring I wish not, | though burned it was
POEM	Of old with Othin's son;
POEM	In Gymir's home | is no lack of gold
POEM	In the wealth my father wields."
POEM	
POEM	Skirnir spake:
POEM	23. "Seest thou, maiden, | this keen, bright sword
POEM	That I hold here in my hand?
POEM	Thy head from thy neck | shall I straightway hew,
POEM	If thou wilt not do my will."
POEM	
POEM	Gerth spake:
POEM	24. "For no man's sake | will I ever suffer
POEM	To be thus moved by might;
POEM	But gladly, methinks, | will Gymir seek
POEM	To fight if he finds thee here."
POEM	
POEM	Skirnir spake:
POEM	25. "Seest thou, maiden, | this keen, bright sword
POEM	That I hold here in my hand?
POEM	Before its blade the | old giant bends,--
POEM	Thy father is doomed to die.
POEM	
POEM	26. "I strike thee, maid, | with my magic staff,
POEM	To tame thee to work my will;
POEM	There shalt thou go | where never again
POEM	The sons of men shall see thee.
POEM	
POEM	27. "On the eagle's hill | shalt thou ever sit,
POEM	And gaze on the gates of Hel;
POEM	More loathsome to thee | than the light-hued snake
POEM	To men, shall thy meat become.
POEM	
POEM	28. "Fearful to see, | if thou comest forth,
POEM	Hrimnir will stand and stare,
POEM	(Men will marvel at thee;)
POEM	More famed shalt thou grow | than the watchman of the gods!
POEM	Peer forth, then, from thy prison,
POEM	
POEM	29. "Rage and longing, | fetters and wrath,
POEM	Tears and torment are thine;
POEM	Where thou sittest down | my doom is on thee
POEM	Of heavy heart
POEM	And double dole.
POEM	
POEM	30. "In the giants' home | shall vile things harm thee
POEM	Each day with evil deeds;
POEM	Grief shalt thou get | instead of gladness,
POEM	And sorrow to suffer with tears.
POEM	
POEM	31. "With three-headed giants | thou shalt dwell ever,
POEM	Or never know a husband;
POEM	(Let longing grip thee, | let wasting waste thee,--)
POEM	Be like to the thistle | that in the loft
POEM	Was cast and there was crushed.
POEM	
POEM	32. "I go to the wood, | and to the wet forest,
POEM	To win a magic wand;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	I won a magic wand.
POEM	
POEM	33. "Othin grows angry, | angered is the best of the gods,
POEM	Freyr shall be thy foe,
POEM	Most evil maid, | who the magic wrath
POEM	Of gods hast got for thyself.
POEM	
POEM	34. "Give heed, frost-rulers, | hear it, giants.
POEM	Sons of Suttung,
POEM	And gods, ye too,
POEM	How I forbid | and how I ban
POEM	The meeting of men with the maid,
POEM	(The joy of men with the maid.)
POEM	
POEM	35. "Hrimgrimnir is he, | the giant who shall have thee
POEM	In the depth by the doors of Hel;
POEM	To the frost-giants' halls | each day shalt thou fare,
POEM	Crawling and craving in vain,
POEM	(Crawling and having no hope.)
POEM	
POEM	36. "Base wretches there | by the root of the tree
POEM	Will hold for thee horns of filth;
POEM	A fairer drink | shalt thou never find,
POEM	Maid, to meet thy wish,
POEM	(Maid, to meet my wish.)
POEM	
POEM	37. "I write thee a charm | and three runes therewith,
POEM	Longing and madness and lust;
POEM	But what I have writ | I may yet unwrite
POEM	If I find a need therefor."
POEM	
POEM	Gerth spake:
POEM	38. "Find welcome rather, | and with it take
POEM	The frost-cup filled with mead;
POEM	Though I did not believe | that I should so love
POEM	Ever one of the Wanes."
POEM	
POEM	Skirnir spake:
POEM	39. "My tidings all | must I truly learn
POEM	Ere homeward hence I ride:
POEM	How soon thou wilt | with the mighty son
POEM	Of Njorth a meeting make."
POEM	
POEM	Gerth spake:
POEM	40. Barri there is, | which we both know well,
POEM	A forest fair and still;
POEM	And nine nights hence | to the son of Njorth
POEM	Will Gerth there grant delight."
POEM	Then Skirnir rode home. Freyr stood without, and spoke to him, and asked for tidings:
POEM	
POEM	41. "Tell me, Skimir, | ere thou take off the saddle,
POEM	Or farest forward a step:
POEM	What hast thou done | in the giants' dwelling
POEM	To make glad thee or me?"
POEM	Skirnir spoke:
POEM	
POEM	42. "Barri there is, | which we both know well,
POEM	A forest fair and still;
POEM	And nine nights hence | to the son of Njorth
POEM	Will Gerth there grant delight."
POEM	
POEM	Freyr spake:
POEM	43. "Long is one night, | longer are two;
POEM	How then shall I bear three?
POEM	Often to me | has a month seemed less
POEM	Than now half a night of desire."

POEM	1. "Who is the fellow yonder, | on the farther shore of the sound?"
POEM	
POEM	The ferryman spake:
POEM	2. "What kind of a peasant is yon, | that calls o'er the bay?"
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	3. "Ferry me over the sound; | I will feed thee therefor in the morning;
POEM	A basket I have on my back, | and food therein, none better;
POEM	At leisure I ate, | ere the house I left,
POEM	Of herrings and porridge, | so plenty I had."
POEM	
POEM	The ferryman spake:
POEM	4. "Of thy morning feats art thou proud, | but the future thou knowest not wholly;
POEM	Doleful thine home-coming is: | thy mother, me thinks, is dead."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	5. "Now hast thou said | what to each must seem
POEM	The mightiest grief, | that my mother is dead."
POEM	
POEM	The ferryman spake:
POEM	6. "Three good dwellings, | methinks, thou hast not;
POEM	Barefoot thou standest, | and wearest a beggar's dress;
POEM	Not even hose dost thou have."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	7. "Steer thou hither the boat; | the landing here shall I show thee;
POEM	But whose the craft | that thou keepest on the shore?"
POEM	
POEM	The ferryman spake:
POEM	8. "Hildolf is he | who bade me have it,
POEM	A hero wise; | his home is at Rathsey's sound.
POEM	He bade me no robbers to steer, | nor stealers of steeds,
POEM	But worthy men, | and those whom well do I know.
POEM	Say now thy name, | if over the sound thou wilt fare."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	9. "My name indeed shall I tell, | though in danger I am,
POEM	And all my race; | I am Othin's son,
POEM	Meili's brother, | and Magni's father,
POEM	The strong one of the gods; | with Thor now speech canst thou get.
POEM	And now would I know | what name thou hast."
POEM	
POEM	The ferryman spake:
POEM	10. "Harbarth am I, | and seldom I hide my name."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	11. "Why shouldst thou hide thy name, | if quarrel thou hast not?"
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	12. "And though I had a quarrel, | from such as thou art
POEM	Yet none the less | my life would I guard,
POEM	Unless I be doomed to die."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	13. "Great trouble, methinks, | would it be to come to thee,
POEM	To wade the waters across, | and wet my middle;
POEM	Weakling, well shall I pay | thy mocking words,
POEM	if across the sound I come."
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	14. "Here shall I stand | and await thee here;
POEM	Thou hast found since Hrungnir died | no fiercer man."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	15. "Fain art thou to tell | how with Hrungnir I fought,
POEM	The haughty giant, | whose head of stone was made;
POEM	And yet I felled him, | and stretched him before me.
POEM	What, Harbarth, didst thou the while?"
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	16. "Five full winters | with Fjolvar was I,
POEM	And dwelt in the isle | that is Algrön called;
POEM	There could we fight, | and fell the slain,
POEM	Much could we seek, | and maids could master."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	17. "How won ye success with your women?"
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	18. "Lively women we had, | if they wise for us were;
POEM	Wise were the women we had, | if they kind for us were;
POEM	For ropes of sand | they would seek to wind,
POEM	And the bottom to dig | from the deepest dale.
POEM	Wiser than all | in counsel I was,
POEM	And there I slept | by the sisters seven,
POEM	And joy full great | did I get from each.
POEM	What, Thor, didst thou the while?"
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	19. "Thjazi I felled, | the giant fierce,
POEM	And I hurled the eyes | of Alvaldi's son
POEM	To the heavens hot above;
POEM	Of my deeds the mightiest | marks are these,
POEM	That all men since can see.
POEM	What, Harbarth, didst thou the while?"
POEM	Harbarth spoke:
POEM	
POEM	20. "Much love-craft I wrought | with them who ride by night,
POEM	When I stole them by stealth from their husbands;
POEM	A giant hard | was Hlebarth, methinks:
POEM	His wand he gave me as gift,
POEM	And I stole his wits away."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	21. "Thou didst repay good gifts with evil mind."
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	22. "The oak must have | what it shaves from another;
POEM	In such things each for himself.
POEM	What, Thor, didst thou the while?"
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	23. "Eastward I fared, | of the giants I felled
POEM	Their ill-working women | who went to the mountain;
POEM	And large were the giants' throng | if all were alive;
POEM	No men would there be | in Mithgarth more.
POEM	What, Harbarth, didst thou the while?"
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	24. "In Valland I was, | and wars I raised,
POEM	Princes I angered, | and peace brought never;
POEM	The noble who fall | in the fight hath Othin,
POEM	And Thor hath the race of the thralls."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	25. "Unequal gifts | of men wouldst thou give to the gods,
POEM	If might too much thou shouldst have."
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	26. "Thor has might enough, | but never a heart;
POEM	For cowardly fear | in a glove wast thou fain to crawl,
POEM	And there forgot thou wast Thor;
POEM	Afraid there thou wast, | thy fear was such,
POEM	To fart or sneeze | lest Fjalar should hear."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	27. "Thou womanish Harbarth, | to hell would I smite thee straight,
POEM	Could mine arm reach over the sound."
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	28. "Wherefore reach over the sound, | since strife we have none?
POEM	What, Thor, didst thou do then?"
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	29. "Eastward I was, | and the river I guarded well,
POEM	Where the sons of Svarang | sought me there;
POEM	Stones did they hurl; | small joy did they have of winning;
POEM	Before me there | to ask for peace did they fare.
POEM	What, Harbarth, didst thou the while?"
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	30. "Eastward I was, | and spake with a certain one,
POEM	I played with the linen-white maid, | and met her by stealth;
POEM	I gladdened the gold-decked one, | and she granted me joy."

POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	35. "No heel-biter am I, in truth, | like an old leather shoe in spring."
POEM	Harbarth spoke:
POEM	
POEM	36. "What, Thor, didst thou the while?"
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	37. "In Hlesey the brides | of the Berserkers slew I;

POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	38, "Shame didst thou win, | that women thou slewest, Thor."

POEM	My ship, which well | I had trimmed, did they shake;
POEM	With clubs of iron they threatened, | and Thjalfi they drove off.
POEM	What, Harbarth, didst thou the while?"
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	40. "In the host I was | that hither fared,

POEM	43. "Where foundest thou | so foul and scornful a speech?
POEM	More foul a speech | I never before have heard."
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	44. "I learned it from men, | the men so old,
POEM	Who dwell in the hills of home."

POEM	45. "A name full good | to heaps of stones thou givest
POEM	When thou callest them hills of home."

POEM	Harbarth spake:

POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:

POEM	Louder, I ween, | than a wolf thou cryest,
POEM	If a blow of my hammer thou hast."

POEM	More fitting it were | on him to put forth thy strength."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	49. "Thy tongue still makes thee say | what seems most ill to me,
POEM	Thou witless man! Thou liest, I ween."
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	50. "Truth do I speak, | but slow on thy way thou art;
POEM	Far hadst thou gone | if now in the boat thou hadst fared."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	51. "Thou womanish Harbarth! | here hast thou held me too long."
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	52. "I thought not ever | that Asathor would be hindered
POEM	By a ferryman thus from faring."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	53. "One counsel I bring thee now: | row hither thy boat;
POEM	No more of scoffing; | set Magni's father across."
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	54. "From the sound go hence; | the passage thou hast not."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	55. "The way now show me, since thou takest me not o'er the water."
POEM	
POEM	Harbarth spake:
POEM	56. "To refuse it is little, to fare it is long;
POEM	A while to the stock, and a while to the stone;
POEM	Then the road to thy left, till Verland thou reachest;
POEM	And there shall Fjorgyn her son Thor find,
POEM	And the road of her children she shows him to Othin's realm."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:

POEM	And helpful counsel | to Hlorrithi gave.
POEM	
POEM	5. "There dwells to the east | of Elivagar
POEM	Hymir the wise | at the end of heaven;
POEM	A kettle my father | fierce doth own,
POEM	A mighty vessel | a mile in depth."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	6. "May we win, dost thou think, | this whirler of water?"
POEM	
POEM	Tyr spake:
POEM	Aye, friend, we can, | if cunning we are.
POEM	
POEM	7. Forward that day | with speed they fared,
POEM	From Asgarth came they | to Egil's home;
POEM	The goats with horns | bedecked he guarded;
POEM	Then they sped to the hall | where Hymir dwelt.
POEM	
POEM	8. The youth found his grandam, | that greatly he loathed,
POEM	And full nine hundred | heads she had;
POEM	But the other fair | with gold came forth,
POEM	And the bright-browed one | brought beer to her son.
POEM	
POEM	9. "Kinsman of giants, | beneath the kettle
POEM	Will I set ye both, | ye heroes bold;
POEM	For many a time | my dear-loved mate
POEM	To guests is wrathful | and grim of mind."
POEM	
POEM	10. Late to his home | the misshapen Hymir,
POEM	The giant harsh, | from his hunting came;
POEM	The icicles rattled | as in he came,
POEM	For the fellow's chin-forest | frozen was.
POEM	
POEM	11. "Hail to thee, Hymir! | good thoughts mayst thou have;
POEM	Here has thy son | to thine hall now come;
POEM	(For him have we waited, | his way was long;)
POEM	And with him fares | the foeman of Hroth,
POEM	The friend of mankind, | and Veur they call him.
POEM	
POEM	12. "See where under | the gable they sit!
POEM	Behind the beam | do they hide themselves."
POEM	The beam at the glance | of the giant broke,
POEM	And the mighty pillar | in pieces fell.
POEM	
POEM	13. Eight fell from the ledge, | and one alone,
POEM	The hard-hammered kettle, | of all was whole;
POEM	Forth came they then, | and his foes he sought,
POEM	The giant old, | and held with his eyes.
POEM	
POEM	14. Much sorrow his heart | foretold when he saw
POEM	The giantess' foeman | come forth on the floor;
POEM	Then of the steers | did they bring in three;
POEM	Their flesh to boil | did the giant bid.
POEM	
POEM	15. By a head was each | the shorter hewed,
POEM	And the beasts to the fire | straight they bore;
POEM	The husband of Sif, | ere to sleep he went,
POEM	Alone two oxen | of Hymir's ate.
POEM	
POEM	16. To the comrade hoary | of Hrungnir then
POEM	Did Hlorrithi's meal | full mighty seem;
POEM	Next time at eve | we three must eat
POEM	The food we have | {illegible}s the hunting's spoil.
POEM	
POEM	17. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Fain to row on the sea | was Veur, he said,
POEM	If the giant bold | would give him bait.
POEM	
POEM	Hymir spake:
POEM	18. "Go to the herd, | if thou hast it in mind,
POEM	Thou slayer of giants, | thy bait to seek;
POEM	For there thou soon | mayst find, methinks,
POEM	Bait from the oxen | easy to get."
POEM	
POEM	19. Swift to the wood | the hero went,
POEM	Till before him an ox | all black he found;
POEM	From the beast the slayer | of giants broke
POEM	The fortress high | of his double horns.
POEM	
POEM	Hymir spake:
POEM	20. "Thy works, methinks, | are worse by far,
POEM	Thou steerer of ships, | than when still thou sittest."
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	21. The lord of the goats | bade the ape-begotten
POEM	Farther to steer | the steed of the rollers;
POEM	But the giant said | that his will, forsooth,
POEM	Longer to row | was little enough.
POEM	
POEM	22. Two whales on his hook | did the mighty Hymir
POEM	Soon pull up | on a single cast;
POEM	In the stern the kinsman | of Othin sat,
POEM	And Veur with cunning | his cast prepared.
POEM	
POEM	23. The warder of men, | the worm's destroyer,
POEM	Fixed on his hook | the head of the ox;
POEM	There gaped at the bait | the foe of the gods,
POEM	The girdler of all | the earth beneath.
POEM	
POEM	24. The venomous serpent | swiftly up
POEM	To the boat did Thor, | the bold one, pull;
POEM	With his hammer the loathly | hill of the hair
POEM	Of the brother of Fenrir | he smote from above.
POEM	
POEM	25. The monsters roared, | and the rocks resounded,
POEM	And all the earth | so old was shaken;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Then sank the fish | in the sea forthwith.
POEM	
POEM	26. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Joyless as back | they rowed was the giant;
POEM	Speechless did Hymir | sit at the oars,
POEM	With the rudder he sought | a second wind.
POEM	
POEM	Hymir spake:
POEM	27. "The half of our toil | wilt thou have with me,
POEM	And now make fast | our goat of the flood;
POEM	Or home wilt thou bear | the whales to the house,
POEM	Across the gorge | of the wooded glen?"
POEM	
POEM	28. Hlorrithi stood | and the stem he gripped,
POEM	And the sea-horse with water | awash he lifted;
POEM	Oars and bailer | and all he bore
POEM	With the surf-swine home | to the giant's house.
POEM	
POEM	29. His might the giant | again would match,
POEM	For stubborn he was, | with the strength of Thor;
POEM	None truly strong, | though stoutly he rowed,
POEM	Would he call save one | who could break the cup.
POEM	
POEM	30. Hlorrithi then, | when the cup he held,
POEM	Struck with the glass | the pillars of stone;
POEM	As he sat the posts | in pieces he shattered,
POEM	Yet the glass to Hymir whole they brought.
POEM	
POEM	31. But the loved one fair | of the giant found
POEM	A counsel true, | and told her thought:
POEM	Smite the skull of Hymir, | heavy with food,
POEM	For harder it is | than ever was glass.
POEM	
POEM	32. The goats' mighty ruler | then rose on his knee,
POEM	And with all the strength | of a god he struck;
POEM	Whole was the fellow's | helmet-stem,
POEM	But shattered the wine-cup | rounded was.
POEM	
POEM	Hymir spake:
POEM	33. "Fair is the treasure | that from me is gone,
POEM	Since now the cup | on my knees lies shattered;"
POEM	So spake the giant: | "No more can I say
POEM	In days to be, | 'Thou art brewed, mine ale.'
POEM	
POEM	34. "Enough shall it be | if out ye can bring
POEM	Forth from our house | the kettle here."
POEM	Tyr then twice | to move it tried,
POEM	But before him the kettle | twice stood fast.
POEM	
POEM	35. The father of Mothi | the rim seized firm,
POEM	And before it stood | on the floor below;
POEM	Up on his head | Sif's husband raised it,
POEM	And about his heels | the handles clattered.
POEM	
POEM	36. Not long had they fared, | ere backwards looked
POEM	The son of Othin, | once more to see;
POEM	From their caves in the east | beheld he coming
POEM	With Hymir the throng | of the many-headed.
POEM	
POEM	37. He stood and cast | from his back the kettle,
POEM	And Mjollnir, the lover | of murder, he wielded;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	So all the whales | of the waste he slew.
POEM	
POEM	38. Not long had they fared | ere one there lay
POEM	Of Hlorrithi's goats | half-dead on the ground;
POEM	In his leg the pole-horse | there was lame;
POEM	The deed the evil | Loki had done.
POEM	
POEM	39. But ye all have heard,-- | for of them who have
POEM	The tales of the gods, | who better can tell?
POEM	What prize he won | from the wilderness-dweller,
POEM	Who both his children | gave him to boot.
POEM	
POEM	40. The mighty one came | to the council of gods,
POEM	And the kettle he had | that Hymir's was;
POEM	So gladly their ale | the gods could drink
POEM	In Ægir's hall | at the autumn-time.
TITLE	LOKASENNA
SUBTITLE	Loki's Wrangling
POEM	1. "Speak now, Eldir, | for not one step
POEM	Farther shalt thou fare;
POEM	What ale-talk here | do they have within,
POEM	The sons of the glorious gods?"
POEM	
POEM	Eldir spake:
POEM	2. "Of their weapons they talk, | and their might in war,
POEM	The sons of the glorious gods;
POEM	From the gods and elves | who are gathered here
POEM	No friend in words shalt thou find."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	3. "In shall I go | into Ægir's hall,
POEM	For the feast I fain would see;
POEM	Bale and hatred | I bring to the gods,
POEM	And their mead with venom I mix."
POEM	
POEM	Eldir spake:
POEM	4. "If in thou goest | to Ægir's hall,
POEM	And fain the feast wouldst see,
POEM	And with slander and spite | wouldst sprinkle the gods,
POEM	Think well lest they wipe it on thee."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	5. "Bethink thee, Eldir, | if thou and I
POEM	Shall strive with spiteful speech;
POEM	Richer I grow | in ready words
POEM	If thou speakest too much to me."
POEM	Then Loki went into the hall, but when they who were there saw who had entered, they were all silent.
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	6. "Thirsty I come | into this thine hall,
POEM	I, Lopt, from a journey long,
POEM	To ask of the gods | that one should give
POEM	Fair mead for a drink to me.
POEM	
POEM	7. "Why sit ye silent, | swollen with pride,
POEM	Ye gods, and no answer give?
POEM	At your feast a place | and a seat prepare me,
POEM	Or bid me forth to fare."
POEM	
POEM	Bragi spake:
POEM	8. "A place and a seat | will the gods prepare
POEM	No more in their midst for thee;
POEM	For the gods know well | what men they wish
POEM	To find at their mighty feasts."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	9. "Remember, Othin, | in olden days
POEM	That we both our blood have mixed;
POEM	Then didst thou promise | no ale to pour,
POEM	Unless it were brought for us both."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	10. "Stand forth then, Vithar, | and let the wolf's father
POEM	Find a seat at our feast;
POEM	Lest evil should Loki | speak aloud
POEM	Here within Ægir's hall."
POEM	Then Vithar arose and poured drink for Loki; but before he drank he spoke to the gods:
POEM	
POEM	11. "Hail to you, gods! | ye goddesses, hail!
POEM	Hail to the holy throng!
POEM	Save for the god | who yonder sits,
POEM	Bragi there on the bench."
POEM	
POEM	Bragi spake:
POEM	12. "A horse and a sword | from my hoard will I give,
POEM	And a ring gives Bragi to boot,
POEM	That hatred thou makst not | among the gods;
POEM	So rouse not the great ones to wrath."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	13. "In horses and rings | thou shalt never be rich,
POEM	Bragi, but both shalt thou lack;
POEM	Of the gods and elves | here together met
POEM	Least brave in battle art thou,
POEM	(And shyest thou art of the shot.)"
POEM	
POEM	Bragi spake:
POEM	14. "Now were I without | as I am within,
POEM	And here in Ægir's hall,
POEM	Thine head would I bear | in mine hands away,
POEM	And pay thee the price of thy lies."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	15. "In thy seat art thou bold, | not so are thy deeds,
POEM	Bragi, adorner of benches!
POEM	Go out and fight | if angered thou feelest,
POEM	No hero such forethought has."
POEM	
POEM	Ithun spake:
POEM	16. "Well, prithee, Bragi, | his kinship weigh,
POEM	Since chosen as wish-son he was;
POEM	And speak not to Loki | such words of spite
POEM	Here within Ægir's hall."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	17. "Be silent, Ithun! | thou art, I say,
POEM	Of women most lustful in love,
POEM	Since thou thy washed-bright | arms didst wind
POEM	About thy brother's slayer."
POEM	
POEM	Ithun spake:
POEM	18. "To Loki I speak not | with spiteful words
POEM	Here within Ægir's hall;
POEM	And Bragi I calm, | who is hot with beer,
POEM	For I wish not that fierce they should fight."
POEM	
POEM	Gefjun spake:
POEM	19. "Why, ye gods twain, | with bitter tongues
POEM	Raise hate among us here?
POEM	Loki is famed | for his mockery foul,
POEM	And the dwellers in heaven he hates."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	20. "Be silent, Gefjun! | for now shall I say
POEM	Who led thee to evil life;
POEM	The boy so fair | gave a necklace bright,
POEM	And about him thy leg was laid."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	21. "Mad art thou, Loki, | and little of wit,
POEM	The wrath of Gefjun to rouse;
POEM	For the fate that is set | for all she sees,
POEM	Even as I, methinks."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	22. "Be silent, Othin! | not justly thou settest
POEM	The fate of the fight among men;
POEM	Oft gavst thou to him | who deserved not the gift,
POEM	To the baser, the battle's prize."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	23. "Though I gave to him | who deserved not the gift,
POEM	To the baser, the battle's prize;
POEM	Winters eight | wast thou under the earth,
POEM	Milking the cows as a maid,
POEM	(Ay, and babes didst thou bear;
POEM	Unmanly thy soul must seem.)"
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	24. "They say that with spells | in Samsey once
POEM	Like witches with charms didst thou work;
POEM	And in witch's guise | among men didst thou go;
POEM	Unmanly thy soul must seem."
POEM	
POEM	Frigg spake:
POEM	25. "Of the deeds ye two | of old have done
POEM	Ye should make no speech among men;
POEM	Whate'er ye have done | in days gone by,
POEM	Old tales should ne'er be told."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	26. "Be silent, Frigg! | thou art Fjorgyn's wife,
POEM	But ever lustful in love;
POEM	For Vili and Ve, | thou wife of Vithrir,
POEM	Both in thy bosom have lain."
POEM	
POEM	Frigg spake:
POEM	27. "If a son like Baldr | were by me now,
POEM	Here within Ægir's hall,
POEM	From the sons of the gods | thou shouldst go not forth
POEM	Till thy fierceness in fight were tried."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	28. "Thou wilt then, Frigg, | that further I tell
POEM	Of the ill that now I know;
POEM	Mine is the blame | that Baldr no more
POEM	Thou seest ride home to the hall."
POEM	
POEM	Freyja spake:
POEM	29. "Mad art thou, Loki, | that known thou makest
POEM	The wrong and shame thou hast wrought;
POEM	The fate of all | does Frigg know well,
POEM	Though herself she says it not."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	30. "Be silent, Freyja! | for fully I know thee,
POEM	Sinless thou art not thyself;
POEM	Of the gods and elves | who are gathered here,
POEM	Each one as thy lover has lain."
POEM	
POEM	Freyja spake:
POEM	31. "False is thy tongue, | and soon shalt thou find
POEM	That it sings thee an evil song;
POEM	The gods are wroth, | and the goddesses all,
POEM	And in grief shalt thou homeward go."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	32. "Be silent, Freyja! | thou foulest witch,
POEM	And steeped full sore in sin;
POEM	In the arms of thy brother | the bright gods caught thee
POEM	When Freyja her wind set free."
POEM	
POEM	Njorth spake:
POEM	33. "Small ill does it work | though a woman may have
POEM	A lord or a lover or both;
POEM	But a wonder it is | that this womanish god
POEM	Comes hither, though babes he has borne."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	34. "Be silent, Njorth; | thou wast eastward sent,
POEM	To the gods as a hostage given;
POEM	And the daughters of Hymir | their privy had
POEM	When use did they make of thy mouth."
POEM	
POEM	Njorth spake:
POEM	35. "Great was my gain, | though long was I gone,
POEM	To the gods as a hostage given;
POEM	The son did I have | whom no man hates,
POEM	And foremost of gods is found."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	36. "Give heed now, Njorth, | nor boast too high,
POEM	No longer I hold it hid;
POEM	With thy sister hadst thou | so fair a son,
POEM	Thus hadst thou no worse a hope."
POEM	
POEM	Tyr spake:
POEM	37. "Of the heroes brave | is Freyr the best
POEM	Here in the home of the gods;
POEM	He harms not maids | nor the wives of men,
POEM	And the bound from their fetters he frees."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	38. "Be silent, Tyr! | for between two men
POEM	Friendship thou ne'er couldst fashion;
POEM	Fain would I tell | how Fenrir once
POEM	Thy right hand rent from thee."
POEM	
POEM	Tyr spake:
POEM	39. "My hand do I lack, | but Hrothvitnir thou,
POEM	And the loss brings longing to both;
POEM	Ill fares the wolf | who shall ever await
POEM	In fetters the fall of the gods."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	40. "Be silent, Tyr! | for a son with me
POEM	Thy wife once chanced to win;
POEM	Not a penny, methinks, | wast thou paid for the wrong,
POEM	Nor wast righted an inch, poor wretch."
POEM	
POEM	Freyr spake:
POEM	41. "By the mouth of the river | the wolf remains
POEM	Till the gods to destruction go;
POEM	Thou too shalt soon, | if thy tongue is not stilled,
POEM	Be fettered, thou forger of ill."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	42. "The daughter of Gymir | with gold didst thou buy,
POEM	And sold thy sword to boot;
POEM	But when Muspell's sons | through Myrkwood ride,
POEM	Thou shalt weaponless wait, poor wretch."
POEM	
POEM	Byggvir spake:
POEM	43. "Had I birth so famous | as Ingunar-Freyr,
POEM	And sat in so lofty a seat,
POEM	I would crush to marrow | this croaker of ill,
POEM	And beat all his body to bits."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	44. "What little creature | goes crawling there,
POEM	Snuffling and snapping about?
POEM	At Freyr's ears ever | wilt thou be found,
POEM	Or muttering hard at the mill."
POEM	
POEM	Byggvir spake:
POEM	45. "Byggvir my name, | and nimble am I,
POEM	As gods and men do grant;
POEM	And here am I proud | that the children of Hropt
POEM	Together all drink ale."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	46. "Be silent, Byggvir! | thou never couldst set
POEM	Their shares of the meat for men;
POEM	Hid in straw on the floor, | they found thee not
POEM	When heroes were fain to fight."
POEM	
POEM	Heimdall spake:
POEM	47. "Drunk art thou, Loki, | and mad are thy deeds,
POEM	Why, Loki, leavst thou this not?
POEM	For drink beyond measure | will lead all men
POEM	No thought of their tongues to take."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	48. "Be silent, Heimdall! | in days long since
POEM	Was an evil fate for thee fixed;
POEM	With back held stiff | must thou ever stand,
POEM	As warder of heaven to watch."
POEM	
POEM	Skathi spake:
POEM	49. "Light art thou, Loki, | but longer thou mayst not
POEM	In freedom flourish thy tail;
POEM	On the rocks the gods bind thee | with bowels torn
POEM	Forth from thy frost-cold son."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	50. "Though on rocks the gods bind me | with bowels torn
POEM	Forth from my frost-cold son,
POEM	I was first and last | at the deadly fight
POEM	There where Thjazi we caught."
POEM	
POEM	Skathi spake:
POEM	51. "Wert thou first and last | at the deadly fight
POEM	There where Thjazi was caught,
POEM	From my dwellings and fields | shall ever come forth
POEM	A counsel cold for thee."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	52. "More lightly thou spakest | with Laufey's son,
POEM	When thou badst me come to thy bed;
POEM	Such things must be known | if now we two
POEM	Shall seek our sins to tell."
POEM	Then Sif came forward and poured mead for Loki in a crystal cup, and said:
POEM	
POEM	53. "Hail too thee, Loki, | and take thou here
POEM	The crystal cup of old mead;
POEM	For me at least, | alone of the gods,
POEM	Blameless thou knowest to be."
POEM	He took the horn, and drank therefrom:
POEM	
POEM	54. "Alone thou wert | if truly thou wouldst
POEM	All men so shyly shun;
POEM	But one do I know | full well, methinks,
POEM	Who had thee from Hlorrithi's arms,--
POEM	(Loki the crafty in lies.)"
POEM	
POEM	Beyla spake:
POEM	55. "The mountains shake, | and surely I think
POEM	From his home comes Hlorrithi now;
POEM	He will silence the man | who is slandering here
POEM	Together both gods and men."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	56. "Be silent, Beyla! | thou art Byggvir's wife,
POEM	And deep art thou steeped in sin;
POEM	A greater shame | to the gods came ne'er,
POEM	Befouled thou art with thy filth."
POEM	
POEM	Then came Thor forth, and spake:
POEM	57. "Unmanly one, cease, | or the mighty hammer,
POEM	Mjollnir, shall close thy mouth;
POEM	Thy shoulder-cliff | shall I cleave from thy neck,
POEM	And so shall thy life be lost."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	58. "Lo, in has come | the son of Earth:
POEM	Why threaten so loudly, Thor?
POEM	Less fierce thou shalt go | to fight with the wolf
POEM	When he swallows Sigfather up."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	59. "Unmanly one, cease, | or the mighty hammer,
POEM	Mjollnir, shall close thy mouth;
POEM	I shall hurl thee up | and out in the East,
POEM	Where men shall see thee no more."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	60. "That thou hast fared | on the East-road forth
POEM	To men shouldst thou say no more;
POEM	In the thumb of a glove | didst thou hide, thou great one,
POEM	And there forgot thou wast Thor."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	61. "Unmanly one, cease, | or the mighty hammer,
POEM	Mjollnir, shall close thy mouth;
POEM	My right hand shall smite thee | with Hrungnir's slayer,
POEM	Till all thy bones are broken."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	62. "Along time still | do I think to live,
POEM	Though thou threatenest thus with thy hammer;
POEM	Rough seemed the straps | of Skrymir's wallet,
POEM	When thy meat thou mightest not get,
POEM	(And faint from hunger didst feel.)"
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	63. "Unmanly one, cease, | or the mighty hammer,
POEM	Mjollnir, shall close thy mouth;
POEM	The slayer of Hrungnir | shall send thee to hell,
POEM	And down to the gate of death."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	64. "'1 have said to the gods | and the sons of the god,
POEM	The things that whetted my thoughts;
POEM	But before thee alone | do I now go forth,
POEM	For thou fightest well, I ween.
POEM	
POEM	65. "Ale hast thou brewed, | but, Ægir, now
POEM	Such feasts shalt thou make no more;
POEM	O'er all that thou hast | which is here within
POEM	Shall play the flickering flames,
POEM	(And thy back shall be burnt with fire.)"
POEM	And after that Loki hid himself in Franang's waterfall in the guise of a salmon, and there the gods took
POEM	him. He was bound with the bowels of his son Vali, but his son Narfi was changed to a wolf. Skathi took
POEM	a poison-snake and fastened it up over Loki's face, and the poison dropped thereon. Sigyn, Loki's wife,
POEM	sat there and held a shell under the poison, but when the shell was full she bore away the poison, and
POEM	meanwhile the poison dropped on Loki. Then he struggled so hard that the whole earth shook therewith;
POEM	and now that is called an earthquake.

POEM	Wilt thou, Freyja, | thy feather-dress lend me,
POEM	That so my hammer | I may seek?
POEM	
POEM	Freyja spake:
POEM	4. "Thine should it be | though of silver bright,
POEM	And I would give it | though 'twere of gold."
POEM	Then Loki flew, | and the feather-dress whirred,
POEM	Till he left behind him | the home of the gods,
POEM	And reached at last | the realm of the giants.
POEM	
POEM	5. Thrym sat on a mound, | the giants' master,
POEM	Leashes of gold | he laid for his dogs,
POEM	And stroked and smoothed | the manes of his steeds.
POEM	
POEM	Thrym spake:
POEM	6. "How fare the gods, | how fare the elves?
POEM	Why comst thou alone | to the giants' land?"
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	III fare the gods, | ill fare the elves!
POEM	Hast thou hidden | Hlorrithi's hammer?
POEM	
POEM	Thrym spake:
POEM	7. "I have hidden | Hlorrithi's hammer,
POEM	Eight miles down | deep in the earth;
POEM	And back again | shall no man bring it
POEM	If Freyja I win not | to be my wife."
POEM	
POEM	8. Then Loki flew, | and the feather-dress whirred,
POEM	Till he left behind him | the home of the giants,
POEM	And reached at last | the realm of the gods.
POEM	There in the courtyard | Thor he met:
POEM	
POEM	Hear now the speech | that first he spake:
POEM	9. "Hast thou found tidings | as well as trouble?
POEM	Thy news in the air | shalt thou utter now;
POEM	Oft doth the sitter | his story forget,
POEM	And lies he speaks | who lays himself down."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	I0. "Trouble I have, | and tidings as well:
POEM	Thrym, king of the giants, | keeps thy hammer,
POEM	And back again | shall no man bring it
POEM	If Freyja he wins not | to be his wife."
POEM	
POEM	11. Freyja the fair | then went they to find
POEM	
POEM	Hear now the speech | that first he spake:
POEM	Bind on, Freyja, | the bridal veil,
POEM	For we two must haste | to the giants' home.
POEM	
POEM	12. Wrathful was Freyja, | and fiercely she snorted,
POEM	And the dwelling great | of the gods was shaken,
POEM	And burst was the mighty | Brisings' necklace:
POEM	Most lustful indeed | should I look to all
POEM	If I journeyed with thee | to the giants' home.
POEM	
POEM	13. Then were the gods | together met,
POEM	And the goddesses came | and council held,
POEM	And the far-famed ones | a plan would find,
POEM	How they might Hlorrithi's | hammer win.
POEM	
POEM	14. Then Heimdall spake, | whitest of the gods,
POEM	Like the Wanes he knew | the future well:
POEM	Bind we on Thor | the bridal veil,
POEM	Let him bear the mighty | Brisings' necklace;
POEM	
POEM	15. Keys around him | let there rattle,
POEM	And down to his knees | hang woman's dress;
POEM	With gems full broad | upon his breast,
POEM	And a pretty cap | to crown his head."
POEM	
POEM	16. Then Thor the mighty | his answer made:
POEM	Me would the gods | unmanly call
POEM	If I let bind | the bridal veil.
POEM	
POEM	17. Then Loki spake, | the son of Laufey:
POEM	Be silent, Thor, | and speak not thus;
POEM	Else will the giants | in Asgarth dwell
POEM	If thy hammer is brought not | home to thee.
POEM	
POEM	8. Then bound they on Thor | the bridal veil,
POEM	And next the mighty | Brisings' necklace.
POEM	
POEM	19. Keys around him | let they rattle,
POEM	And down to his knees | hung woman's dress;
POEM	With gems full broad | upon his breast,
POEM	And a pretty cap | to crown his head.
POEM	
POEM	20. Then Loki spake, | the son of Laufey:
POEM	As thy maid-servant thither | I go with thee;
POEM	We two shall haste | to the giants' home.
POEM	
POEM	21. Then home the goats | to the hall were driven,
POEM	They wrenched at the halters, | swift were they to run;
POEM	The mountains burst, | earth burned with fire,
POEM	And Othin's son | sought Jotunheim.
POEM	
POEM	22. Then loud spake Thrym, | the giants' leader:
POEM	Bestir ye, giants, | put straw on the benches;
POEM	Now Freyja they bring | to be my bride,
POEM	The daughter of Njorth | out of Noatun.
POEM	
POEM	23. Gold-horned cattle | go to my stables,
POEM	Jet-black oxen, | the giant's joy;
POEM	Many my gems, | and many my jewels,
POEM	Freyja alone | did I lack, methinks."
POEM	
POEM	24. Early it was | to evening come,
POEM	And forth was borne | the beer for the giants;
POEM	Thor alone ate an ox, | and eight salmon,
POEM	All the dainties as well | that were set for the women;
POEM	And drank Sif's mate | three tuns of mead.
POEM	
POEM	25. Then loud spake Thrym, | the giants' leader:
POEM	Who ever saw bride | more keenly bite?
POEM	I ne'er saw bride | with a broader bite,
POEM	Nor a maiden who drank | more mead than this!
POEM	
POEM	26. Hard by there sat | the serving-maid wise,
POEM	So well she answered | the giant's words:
POEM	From food has Freyja | eight nights fasted,
POEM	So hot was her longing | for Jotunheim.
POEM	
POEM	27. Thrym looked 'neath the veil, | for he longed to kiss,
POEM	But back he leaped | the length of the hall:
POEM	Why are so fearful | the eyes of Freyja?
POEM	Fire, methinks, | from her eyes burns forth.
POEM	
POEM	28. Hard by there sat | the serving-maid wise,
POEM	So well she answered | the giant's words:
POEM	No sleep has Freyja | for eight nights found,
POEM	So hot was her longing | for Jotunheim.
POEM	
POEM	29. Soon came the giant's | luckless sister,
POEM	Who feared not to ask | the bridal fee:
POEM	From thy hands the rings | of red gold take,
POEM	If thou wouldst win | my willing love,
POEM	(My willing love | and welcome glad.)
POEM	
POEM	30: Then loud spake Thrym, | the giants' leader:
POEM	Bring in the hammer | to hallow the bride;
POEM	On the maiden's knees | let Mjollnir lie,
POEM	That us both the band | of Vor may bless.
POEM	
POEM	31. The heart in the breast | of Hlorrithi laughed
POEM	When the hard-souled one | his hammer beheld;
POEM	First Thrym, the king | of the giants, he killed,
POEM	Then all the folk | of the giants he felled.
POEM	
POEM	32. The giant's sister | old he slew,
POEM	She who had begged | the bridal fee;
POEM	A stroke she got | in the shilling's stead,
POEM	And for many rings | the might of the hammer.
POEM	
POEM	33. And so his hammer | got Othin's son.

SUBTITLE	The Ballad of Alvis
POEM	1. "Now shall the bride | my benches adorn,
POEM	And homeward haste forthwith;
POEM	Eager for wedlock | to all shall I seem,
POEM	Nor at home shall they rob me of rest."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	2. "What, pray, art thou? | Why so pale round the nose?
POEM	By the dead hast thou lain of late?
POEM	To a giant like | dost thou look, methinks;
POEM	Thou wast not born for the bride."
POEM	
POEM	Alvis spake:
POEM	3. "Alvis am I, | and under the earth
POEM	My home 'neath the rocks I have;
POEM	With the wagon-guider | a word do I seek,
POEM	Let the gods their bond not break."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	4. "Break it shall I, | for over the bride
POEM	Her father has foremost right;
POEM	At home was I not | when the promise thou hadst,
POEM	And I give her alone of the gods."
POEM	
POEM	Alvis spake:
POEM	5. "What hero claims | such right to hold
POEM	O'er the bride that shines so bright?
POEM	Not many will know thee, | thou wandering man!
POEM	Who was bought with rings to bear thee?"
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:
POEM	6. "Vingthor, the wanderer | wide, am I,
POEM	And I am Sithgrani's son;
POEM	Against my will | shalt thou get the maid,
POEM	And win the marriage word."
POEM	
POEM	Alvis spake:
POEM	7. "Thy good-will now | shall I quickly get,
POEM	And win the marriage word;
POEM	I long to have, | and I would not lack,
POEM	This snow-white maid for mine."
POEM	
POEM	Thor spake:

POEM	1. Once were the gods | together met,
POEM	And the goddesses came | and council held,
POEM	And the far-famed ones | the truth would find,
POEM	Why baleful dreams | to Baldr had come.
POEM	
POEM	2. Then Othin rose, | the enchanter old,
POEM	And the saddle he laid | on Sleipnir's back;
POEM	Thence rode he down | to Niflhel deep,
POEM	And the hound he met | that came from hell.
POEM	
POEM	3. Bloody he was | on his breast before,
POEM	At the father of magic | he howled from afar;
POEM	Forward rode Othin, | the earth resounded
POEM	Till the house so high | of Hel he reached.
POEM	
POEM	4. Then Othin rode | to the eastern door,
POEM	There, he knew well, | was the wise-woman's grave;
POEM	Magic he spoke | and mighty charms,
POEM	Till spell-bound she rose, | and in death she spoke:
POEM	
POEM	5. "What is the man, | to me unknown,
POEM	That has made me travel | the troublous road?
POEM	I was snowed on with snow, | and smitten with rain,
POEM	And drenched with dew; | long was I dead."
POEM	
POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	6. "Vegtam my name, | I am Valtam's son;
POEM	Speak thou of hell, | for of heaven I know:

POEM	
POEM	The Wise-Woman spake:
POEM	7. "Here for Baldr | the mead is brewed,

POEM	But their hope is gone | from the mighty gods.
POEM	Unwilling I spake, | and now would be still."

POEM	Othin spake:
POEM	No wise-woman art thou, | nor wisdom hast;
POEM	Of giants three | the mother art thou.
POEM	
POEM	The Wise-Woman spake:
POEM	14. "Home ride, Othin, | be ever proud;

TITLE	RIGSTHULA
SUBTITLE	The Song of Rig
POEM	1. Men say there went | by ways so green
POEM	Of old the god, | the aged and wise,
POEM	Mighty and strong | did Rig go striding.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	2. Forward he went | on the midmost way,
POEM	He came to a dwelling, | a door on its posts;
POEM	In did he fare, | on the floor was a fire,
POEM	Two hoary ones | by the hearth there sat,
POEM	Ai and Edda, | in olden dress.
POEM	
POEM	3. Rig knew well | wise words to speak,
POEM	Soon in the midst | of the room he sat,
POEM	And on either side | the others were.
POEM	
POEM	4. A loaf of bread | did Edda bring,
POEM	Heavy and thick | and swollen with husks;
POEM	Forth on the table | she set the fare,
POEM	And broth for the meal | in a bowl there was.
POEM	(Calf's flesh boiled | was the best of the dainties.)
POEM	
POEM	5. Rig knew well | wise words to speak,
POEM	Thence did he rise, | made ready to sleep;
POEM	Soon in the bed | himself did he lay,
POEM	And on either side | the others were.
POEM	
POEM	6. Thus was he there | for three nights long,
POEM	Then forward he went | on the midmost way,
POEM	And so nine months | were soon passed by.
POEM	
POEM	7. A son bore Edda, | with water they sprinkled him,
POEM	With a cloth his hair | so black they covered;
POEM	Thræll they named him, | . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	8. The skin was wrinkled | and rough on his hands,
POEM	Knotted his knuckles, | . . . . .
POEM	Thick his fingers, | and ugly his face,
POEM	Twisted his back, | and big his heels.
POEM	
POEM	9. He began to grow, | and to gain in strength,
POEM	Soon of his might | good use he made;
POEM	With bast he bound, | and burdens carried,
POEM	Home bore faggots | the whole day long.
POEM	
POEM	10. One came to their home, | crooked her legs,
POEM	Stained were her feet, | and sunburned her arms,
POEM	Flat was her nose; | her name was Thir.
POEM	
POEM	11. Soon in the midst | of the room she sat,
POEM	By her side there sat | the son of the house;
POEM	They whispered both, | and the bed made ready,
POEM	Thræll and Thir, | till the day was through.
POEM	
POEM	12. Children they had, | they lived and were happy,
POEM	Fjosnir and Klur | they were called, methinks,
POEM	Hreim and Kleggi, | Kefsir, Fulnir,
POEM	Drumb, Digraldi, | Drott and Leggjaldi,
POEM	Lut and Hosvir; | the house they cared for,
POEM	Ground they dunged, | and swine they guarded,
POEM	Goats they tended, | and turf they dug.
POEM	
POEM	13. Daughters had they, | Drumba and Kumba,
POEM	Ökkvinkalfa, | Arinnefla,
POEM	Ysja and Ambott, | Eikintjasna,
POEM	Totrughypja | and Tronubeina;
POEM	And thence has risen | the race of thralls.
POEM	
POEM	14. Forward went Rig, | his road was straight,
POEM	To a hall he came, | and a door there hung;
POEM	In did he fare, | on the floor was a fire:
POEM	Afi and Amma | owned the house.
POEM	
POEM	15. There sat the twain, | and worked at their tasks:
POEM	The man hewed wood | for the weaver's beam;
POEM	His beard was trimmed, | o'er his brow a curl,
POEM	His clothes fitted close; | in the corner a chest.
POEM	
POEM	16. The woman sat | and the distaff wielded,
POEM	At the weaving with arms | outstretched she worked;
POEM	On her head was a band, | on her breast a smock;
POEM	On her shoulders a kerchief | with clasps there was.
POEM	
POEM	17. Rig knew well | wise words to speak,
POEM	Soon in the midst | of the room he sat,
POEM	And on either side | the others were.
POEM	
POEM	18. Then took Amma | . . . . .
POEM	The vessels full | with the fare she set,
POEM	Calf's flesh boiled | was the best of the dainties.
POEM	
POEM	19. Rig knew well | wise words to speak,
POEM	He rose from the board, | made ready to sleep;
POEM	Soon in the bed | himself did he lay,
POEM	And on either side | the others were.
POEM	
POEM	20. Thus was he there | for three nights long,
POEM	Then forward he went | on the midmost way,
POEM	And so nine months | were soon passed by.
POEM	
POEM	21. A son bore Amma, | with water they sprinkled him,
POEM	Karl they named him; | in a cloth she wrapped him,
POEM	He was ruddy of face, | and flashing his eyes.
POEM	
POEM	22. He began to grow, | and to gain in strength,
POEM	Oxen he ruled, | and plows made ready,
POEM	Houses he built, | and barns he fashioned,
POEM	Carts he made, | and the plow he managed.
POEM	
POEM	23. Home did they bring | the bride for Karl,
POEM	In goatskins clad, | and keys she bore;
POEM	Snör was her name, | 'neath the veil she sat;
POEM	A home they made ready, | and rings exchanged,
POEM	The bed they decked, | and a dwelling made.
POEM	
POEM	24. Sons they had, | they lived and were happy:
POEM	Hal and Dreng, | Holth, Thegn and Smith,
POEM	Breith and Bondi, | Bundinskeggi,
POEM	Bui and Boddi, | Brattskegg and Segg.
POEM	
POEM	25. Daughters they had, | and their names are here:
POEM	Snot, Bruth, Svanni, | Svarri, Sprakki,
POEM	Fljoth, Sprund and Vif, | Feima, Ristil:
POEM	And thence has risen | the yeomen's race.
POEM	
POEM	26. Thence went Rig, | his road was straight,
POEM	A hall he saw, | the doors faced south;
POEM	The portal stood wide, | on the posts was a ring,
POEM	Then in he fared; | the floor was strewn.
POEM	
POEM	27. Within two gazed | in each other's eyes,
POEM	Fathir and Mothir, | and played with their fingers;
POEM	There sat the house-lord, | wound strings for the bow,
POEM	Shafts he fashioned, | and bows he shaped.
POEM	
POEM	28. The lady sat, | at her arms she looked,
POEM	She smoothed the cloth, | and fitted the sleeves;
POEM	Gay was her cap, | on her breast were clasps,
POEM	Broad was her train, | of blue was her gown,
POEM	Her brows were bright, | her breast was shining,
POEM	Whiter her neck | than new-fallen snow.
POEM	
POEM	29. Rig knew | well wise words to speak,
POEM	Soon in the midst | of the room he sat,
POEM	And on either side | the others were.
POEM	
POEM	30. Then Mothir brought | a broidered cloth,
POEM	Of linen bright, | and the board she covered;
POEM	And then she took | the loaves so thin,
POEM	And laid them, white | from the wheat, on the cloth.
POEM	
POEM	31. Then forth she brought | the vessels full,
POEM	With silver covered, | and set before them,
POEM	Meat all browned, | and well-cooked birds;
POEM	In the pitcher was wine, | of plate were the cups,
POEM	So drank they and talked | till the day was gone.
POEM	
POEM	32. Rig knew well | wise words to speak,
POEM	Soon did he rise, | made ready to sleep;
POEM	So in the bed | himself did he lay,
POEM	And on either side | the others were.
POEM	
POEM	33. Thus was he there | for three nights long,
POEM	Then forward he went | on the midmost way,
POEM	And so nine months | were soon passed by.
POEM	
POEM	34. A son had Mothir, | in silk they wrapped him,
POEM	With water they sprinkled him, | Jarl he was;
POEM	Blond was his hair, | and bright his cheeks,
POEM	Grim as a snake's | were his glowing eyes.
POEM	
POEM	35. To grow in the house | did Jarl begin,
POEM	Shields he brandished, | and bow-strings wound,
POEM	Bows he shot, | and shafts he fashioned,
POEM	Arrows he loosened, | and lances wielded,
POEM	Horses he rode, | and hounds unleashed,
POEM	Swords he handled, | and sounds he swam.
POEM	
POEM	36. Straight from the grove | came striding Rig,
POEM	Rig came striding, | and runes he taught him;
POEM	By his name he called him, | as son he claimed him,
POEM	And bade him hold | his heritage wide,
POEM	His heritage wide, | the ancient homes.
POEM	
POEM	37. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Forward he rode | through the forest dark,
POEM	O'er the frosty crags, | till a hall he found.
POEM	
POEM	38. His spear he shook, | his shield he brandished,
POEM	His horse he spurred, | with his sword he hewed;
POEM	Wars he raised, | and reddened the field,
POEM	Warriors slew he, | and land he won.
POEM	
POEM	39. Eighteen halls | ere long did he hold,
POEM	Wealth did he get, | and gave to all,
POEM	Stones and jewels | and slim-flanked steeds,
POEM	Rings he offered, | and arm-rings shared.
POEM	
POEM	40. His messengers went | by the ways so wet,
POEM	And came to the hall | where Hersir dwelt;
POEM	His daughter was fair | and slender-fingered,
POEM	Erna the wise | the maiden was.
POEM	
POEM	41. Her hand they sought, | and home they brought her,
POEM	Wedded to Jarl | the veil she wore;
POEM	Together they dwelt, | their joy was great,
POEM	Children they had, | and happy they lived.
POEM	
POEM	42. Bur was the eldest, | and Barn the next,
POEM	Joth and Athal, | Arfi, Mog,
POEM	Nith and Svein, | soon they began-
POEM	Sun and Nithjung-- | to play and swim;
POEM	Kund was one, | and the youngest Kon.
POEM	
POEM	43. Soon grew up | the sons of Jarl,
POEM	Beasts they tamed, | and bucklers rounded,
POEM	Shafts they fashioned, | and spears they shook.
POEM	
POEM	44. But Kon the Young | learned runes to use,
POEM	Runes everlasting, | the runes of life;
POEM	Soon could he well | the warriors shield,
POEM	Dull the swordblade, | and still the seas.
POEM	
POEM	45. Bird-chatter learned he, | flames could he lessen.,
POEM	Minds could quiet, | and sorrows calm;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	The might and strength | of twice four men.
POEM	
POEM	46. With Rig-Jarl soon | the runes he shared,
POEM	More crafty he was, | and greater his wisdom;
POEM	The right he sought, | and soon he won it,
POEM	Rig to be called, | and runes to know.
POEM	
POEM	47. Young Kon rode forth | through forest and grove,
POEM	Shafts let loose, | and birds he lured;
POEM	
POEM	There spake a crow | on a bough that sat:
POEM	Why lurest thou, Kon, | the birds to come?
POEM	
POEM	48.  'Twere better forth | on thy steed to fare,
POEM	. . . . . | and the host to slay.
POEM	
POEM	49. "The halls of Dan | and Danp are noble,
POEM	Greater their wealth | than thou bast gained;
POEM	Good are they | at guiding the keel,
POEM	Trying of weapons, | and giving of wounds.

POEM	44. The sea, storm-driven, | seeks heaven itself,
POEM	O'er the earth it flows, | the air grows sterile;

POEM	1. "Wake thee, Groa! | wake, mother good!
POEM	At the doors of the dead I call thee;
POEM	Thy son, bethink thee, | thou badst to seek
POEM	Thy help at the hill of death."
POEM	
POEM	Groa spake:
POEM	2. "What evil vexes | mine only son,
POEM	What baleful fate hast thou found,
POEM	That thou callest thy mother, | who lies in the mould,
POEM	And the world of the living has left?"
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	3. "The woman false | whom my father embraced
POEM	Has brought me a baleful game;
POEM	For she bade me go forth | where none may fare,
POEM	And Mengloth the maid to seek."
POEM	
POEM	Groa spake:

POEM	Thou mayst find, perchance, | what thou fain wouldst have,
POEM	If the fates their favor will give."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	5. "Charms full good | then chant to me, mother,
POEM	And seek thy son to guard;
POEM	For death do I fear | on the way I shall fare,
POEM	And in years am I young, methinks."
POEM	
POEM	Groa spake:

POEM	
POEM	7. "Then next I will chant thee, | if needs thou must travel,
POEM	And wander a purposeless way:
POEM	The bolts of Urth | shall on every side
POEM	Be thy guards on the road thou goest.
POEM	
POEM	8. "Then third I will chant thee, | if threatening streams
POEM	The danger of death shall bring:

POEM	And before thee the waters shall fail.
POEM	
POEM	9. "Then fourth I will chant thee, | if come thy foes
POEM	On the gallows-way against thee:
POEM	Into thine hands | shall their hearts be given,
POEM	And peace shall the warriors wish.
POEM	
POEM	10. "Then fifth I will chant thee, | if fetters perchance
POEM	Shall bind thy bending limbs:
POEM	O'er thy thighs do I chant | a loosening-charm,
POEM	And the lock is burst from the limbs,
POEM	And the fetters fall from the feet.
POEM	
POEM	11. "Then sixth I will chant thee, | if storms on the sea
POEM	Have might unknown to man:
POEM	Yet never shall wind | or wave do harm,
POEM	And calm is the course of thy boat.
POEM	
POEM	12. "Then seventh I chant thee, | if frost shall seek
POEM	To kill thee on lofty crags:
POEM	The fatal cold | shall not grip thy flesh,
POEM	And whole thy body shall be.
POEM	
POEM	13. "Then eighth will I chant thee, | if ever by night

POEM	
POEM	14. "Then ninth will I chant thee, | if needs thou must strive

POEM	And thy mouth of words full wise.
POEM	
POEM	15. "Now fare on the way | where danger waits,
POEM	Let evils not lessen thy love!
POEM	I have stood at the door | of the earth-fixed stones,
POEM	The while I chanted thee charms.
POEM	
POEM	16. "Bear hence, my son, | what thy mother hath said,

POEM	THE LAY OF FJOLSVITH
POEM	
POEM	17. Before the house | he beheld one coming
POEM	To the home of the giants high.
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	What giant is here, | in front of the house,
POEM	And around him fires are flaming?
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	3. "What seekest thou here? | for what is thy search?
POEM	What, friendless one, fain wouldst thou know?
POEM	By the ways so wet | must thou wander hence,
POEM	For, weakling, no home hast thou here."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	19. "What giant is here, | in front of the house,
POEM	To the wayfarer welcome denying?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	Greeting full fair | thou never shalt find,
POEM	So hence shalt thou get thee home.
POEM	
POEM	20. Fjolsvith am I, | and wise am I found,
POEM	But miserly am I with meat;
POEM	Thou never shalt enter | within the house,--
POEM	Go forth like a wolf on thy way!"
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	21. "Few from the joy | of their eyes will go forth,
POEM	When the sight of their loves they seek;
POEM	Full bright are the gates | of the golden hall,
POEM	And a home shall I here enjoy."
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	22. "Tell me now, fellow, | what father thou hast,
POEM	And the kindred of whom thou camst."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	Vindkald am I, | and Varkald's son,
POEM	And Fjolkald his father was.
POEM	
POEM	23. Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	Who is it that holds | and has for his own
POEM	The rule of the hall so rich?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	224. "Mengloth is she, | her mother bore her
POEM	To the son of Svafrthorin;
POEM	She is it that holds | and has for her own
POEM	The rule of the hall so rich."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	25. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	What call they the gate? | for among the gods
POEM	Ne'er saw man so grim a sight."
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	26. "Thrymgjol they call it; | 'twas made by the three,
POEM	The sons of Solblindi;
POEM	And fast as a fetter | the farer it holds,
POEM	Whoever shall lift the latch."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	27. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:

POEM	From the limbs of Leirbrimir;
POEM	I braced it so strongly | that fast it shall stand
POEM	So long as the world shall last."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:

POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	What call they the tree | that casts abroad

POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	30. "Mimameith its name, | and no man knows
POEM	What root beneath it runs;
POEM	And few can guess | what shall fell the tree,
POEM	For fire nor iron shall fell it."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	31. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	What grows from the seed | of the tree so great,
POEM	That fire nor iron shall fell?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	32. "Women, sick | with child, shall seek
POEM	Its fruit to the flames to bear;
POEM	Then out shall come | what within was hid,
POEM	And so is it mighty with men."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:

POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	34. "Vithofnir his name, | and now he shines
POEM	Like lightning on Mimameith's limbs;

POEM	What call they the hounds, | that before the house
POEM	So fierce and angry are?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	36. "Gif call they one, | and Geri the other,
POEM	If now the truth thou wouldst know;
POEM	Great they are, | and their might will grow,
POEM	Till the gods to death are doomed."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	37. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	May no man hope | the house to enter,
POEM	While the hungry hounds are sleeping?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	38. "Together they sleep not, | for so was it fixed
POEM	When the guard to them was given;
POEM	One sleeps by night, | the next by day,
POEM	So no man may enter ever."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	39, "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	Is there no meat | that men may give them,
POEM	And leap within while they eat?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	40. "Two wing-joints there be | in Vithofnir's body,
POEM	If now the truth thou wouldst know;
POEM	That alone is the meat | that men may give them,
POEM	And leap within while they eat."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	41. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	What weapon can send | Vithofnir to seek
POEM	The house of Hel below?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	42. "Lævatein is there, | that Lopt with runes
POEM	Once made by the doors of death;
POEM	In Lægjarn's chest | by Sinmora lies it,
POEM	And nine locks fasten it firm."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	43. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	May a man come thence, | who thither goes,
POEM	And tries the sword to take?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	44. "Thence may he come | who thither goes,
POEM	And tries the sword to take,
POEM	If with him he carries | what few can win,
POEM	To give to the goddess of gold."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	45. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	What treasure is there | that men may take
POEM	To rejoice the giantess pale?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	46. "The sickle bright | in thy wallet bear,
POEM	Mid Vithofnir's feathers found;
POEM	To Sinmora give it, | and then shall she grant
POEM	That the weapon by thee be won."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	47. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	What call they the hall, | encompassed here
POEM	With flickering magic flames?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	48. "Lyr is it called, | and long it shall
POEM	On the tip of a spear-point tremble;
POEM	Of the noble house | mankind has heard,
POEM	But more has it never known."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	49. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	What one of the gods | has made so great
POEM	The hall I behold within?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	50. "Uni and Iri, | Bari and Jari,
POEM	Var and Vegdrasil,
POEM	Dori and Ori, | Delling, and there
POEM	Was Loki, the fear of the folk."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	51. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	What call they the mountain | on which the maid
POEM	Is lying so lovely to see?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	52. "Lyfjaberg is it, | and long shall it be
POEM	A joy to the sick and the sore;
POEM	For well shall grow | each woman who climbs it,
POEM	Though sick full long she has lain."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	53. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	What maidens are they | that at Mengloth's knees
POEM	Are sitting so gladly together?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	54. "Hlif is one named, | Hlifthrasa another,
POEM	Thjothvara call they the third;
POEM	Bjort and Bleik, | Blith and Frith,
POEM	Eir and Aurbotha."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	55. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	Aid bring they to all | who offerings give,
POEM	If need be found therefor?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	56. "Soon aid they all | who offerings give
POEM	On the holy altars high;
POEM	And if danger they see | for the sons of men,
POEM	Then each from ill do they guard."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	57. "Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask,
POEM	For now the truth would I know:
POEM	Lives there the man | who in Mengloth's arms
POEM	So fair may seek to sleep?"
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	58. "No man there is | who in Mengloth's arms
POEM	So fair may seek to sleep,
POEM	Save Svipdag alone, | for the sun-bright maid
POEM	Is destined his bride to be."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	59. "Fling back the gates! | make the gateway wide!
POEM	Here mayst thou Svipdag see!
POEM	Hence get thee to find | if gladness soon
POEM	Mengloth to me will give."
POEM	
POEM	Fjolsvith spake:
POEM	60. "Hearken, Mengloth, | a man is come;
POEM	Go thou the guest to see!
POEM	The hounds are fawning, | the house bursts open,--
POEM	Svipdag, methinks, is there."
POEM	
POEM	Mengloth spake:
POEM	61. "On the gallows high | shall hungry ravens
POEM	Soon thine eyes pluck out,
POEM	If thou liest in saying | that here at last
POEM	The hero is come to my hall.
POEM	
POEM	62. "Whence camest thou hither? | how camest thou here?
POEM	What name do thy kinsmen call thee?
POEM	Thy race and thy name | as a sign must I know,
POEM	That thy bride I am destined to be."
POEM	
POEM	Svipdag spake:
POEM	63. "Svipdag am I, | and Solbjart's son;
POEM	Thence came I by wind-cold ways;
POEM	With the words of Urth | shall no man war,
POEM	Though unearned her gifts be given."
POEM	
POEM	Mengloth spake:
POEM	64. "Welcome thou art, | for long have I waited;
POEM	The welcoming kiss shalt thou win!
POEM	For two who love | is the longed-for meeting
POEM	The greatest gladness of all.
POEM	
POEM	65. "Long have I sat | on Lyfjaberg here,
POEM	Awaiting thee day by day;
POEM	And now I have | what I ever hoped,
POEM	For here thou art come to my hall.
POEM	
POEM	66. "Alike we yearned; | I longed for thee,
POEM	And thou for my love hast longed;
POEM	But now henceforth | together we know
POEM	Our lives to the end we shall live."
TITLE	VÖLUNDARKVITHA
SUBTITLE	The Lay of Völund
POEM	1. Maids from the south | through Myrkwood flew,
POEM	Fair and young, | their fate to follow;
POEM	On the shore of the sea | to rest them they sat,
POEM	The maids of the south, | and flax they spun.
POEM	
POEM	2. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Hlathguth and Hervor, | Hlothver's children,
POEM	And Olrun the Wise | Kjar's daughter was.
POEM	
POEM	3. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	One in her arms | took Egil then
POEM	To her bosom white, | the woman fair.
POEM	
POEM	4. Swan-White second,-- | swan-feathers she wore,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	And her arms the third | of the sisters threw
POEM	Next round Völund's | neck so white.
POEM	
POEM	5. There did they sit | for seven winters,
POEM	In the eighth at last | came their longing again,
POEM	(And in the ninth | did need divide them).
POEM	The maidens yearned | for the murky wood,
POEM	The fair young maids, | their fate to follow.
POEM	
POEM	6. Völund home | from his hunting came,
POEM	From a weary way, | the weather-wise bowman,
POEM	Slagfith and Egil | the hall found empty,
POEM	Out and in went they, | everywhere seeking.
POEM	
POEM	7. East fared Egil | after Olrun,
POEM	And Slagfith south | to seek for Swan-White;
POEM	Völund alone | in Ulfdalir lay,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	8. Red gold he fashioned | with fairest gems,
POEM	And rings he strung | on ropes of bast;
POEM	So for his wife | he waited long,
POEM	If the fair one home | might come to him.
POEM	
POEM	9. This Nithuth learned, | the lord of the Njars,
POEM	That Völund alone | in Ulfdalir lay;
POEM	By night went his men, | their mail-coats were studded,
POEM	Their shields in the waning | moonlight shone.
POEM	
POEM	10. From their saddles the gable | wall they sought,
POEM	And in they went | at the end of the hall;
POEM	Rings they saw there | on ropes of bast,
POEM	Seven hundred | the hero had.
POEM	
POEM	11. Off they took them, | but all they left
POEM	Save one alone | which they bore away.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	12. Völund home | from his hunting came,
POEM	From a weary way, | the weather-wise bowman;
POEM	A brown bear's flesh | would he roast with fire;
POEM	Soon the wood so dry | was burning well,
POEM	(The wind-dried wood | that Völund's was).
POEM	
POEM	13. On the bearskin he rested, | and counted the rings,
POEM	The master of elves, | but one he missed;
POEM	That Hlothver's daughter | had it he thought,
POEM	And the all-wise maid | had come once more.
POEM	
POEM	14. So long he sat | that he fell asleep,
POEM	His waking empty | of gladness was;
POEM	Heavy chains | he saw on his hands,
POEM	And fetters bound | his feet together.
POEM	
POEM	Völund spake:
POEM	15. "What men are they | who thus have laid
POEM	Ropes of bast | to bind me now?"
POEM	Then Nithuth called, | the lord of the Njars:
POEM	How gottest thou, Völund, | greatest of elves,
POEM	These treasures of ours | in Ulfdalir?
POEM	
POEM	Völund spake:
POEM	16. "The gold was not | on Grani's way,
POEM	Far, methinks, is our realm | from the hills of the Rhine;
POEM	I mind me that treasures | more we had
POEM	When happy together | at home we were."
POEM	
POEM	17. Without stood the wife | of Nithuth wise,
POEM	And in she came | from the end of the hall;
POEM	On the floor she stood, | and softly spoke:
POEM	Not kind does he look | who comes from the wood.
POEM	King Nithuth gave to his daughter Bothvild the gold ring that he had taken from the bast rope in Völund's
POEM	
POEM	house, and he himself wore the sword that Völund had had. The queen spake:
POEM	18. "The glow of his eyes | is like gleaming snakes,
POEM	His teeth he gnashes | if now is shown
POEM	The sword, or Bothvild's | ring he sees;
POEM	Let them straightway cut | his sinews of strength,
POEM	And set him then | in Sævarstath."
POEM	So was it done: the sinews in his knee-joints were cut, and he was set in an island which was near the
POEM	mainland, and was called Sævarstath. There he smithied for the king all kinds of precious things. No man
POEM	
POEM	dared to go to him, save only the king himself. Völund spake:
POEM	19. "At Nithuth's girdle | gleams the sword
POEM	That I sharpened keen | with cunningest craft,
POEM	(And hardened the steel | with highest skill;)
POEM	The bright blade far | forever is borne,
POEM	(Nor back shall I see it | borne to my smithy;)
POEM	Now Bothvild gets | the golden ring
POEM	(That was once my bride's,-- | ne'er well shall it be.)"
POEM	
POEM	20. He sat, nor slept, | and smote with his hammer,
POEM	Fast for Nithuth | wonders he fashioned;
POEM	Two boys did go | in his door to gaze,
POEM	Nithuth's sons, | into Sævarstath.
POEM	
POEM	21. They came to the chest, | and they craved the keys,
POEM	The evil was open | when in they looked;
POEM	To the boys it seemed | that gems they saw,
POEM	Gold in plenty | and precious stones.
POEM	
POEM	Völund spake:
POEM	22. "Come ye alone, | the next day come,
POEM	Gold to you both | shall then be given;
POEM	Tell not the maids | or the men of the hall,
POEM	To no one say | that me you have sought."
POEM	
POEM	23. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Early did brother | to brother call:
POEM	Swift let us go | the rings to see.
POEM	
POEM	24. They came to the chest, | and they craved the keys,
POEM	The evil was open | when in they looked;
POEM	He smote off their heads, | and their feet he hid
POEM	Under the sooty | straps of the bellows.
POEM	
POEM	25. Their skulls, once hid | by their hair, he took,
POEM	Set them in silver | and sent them to Nithuth;
POEM	Gems full fair | from their eyes he fashioned,
POEM	To Nithuth's wife | so wise he gave them.
POEM	
POEM	26. And from the teeth | of the twain he wrought
POEM	A brooch for the breast, | to Bothvild he sent it;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	27. Bothvild then | of her ring did boast,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . | "The ring I have broken,
POEM	I dare not say it | save to thee."
POEM	
POEM	Völund spake:
POEM	28. 'I shall weld the break | in the gold so well
POEM	That fairer than ever | thy father shall find it,
POEM	And better much | thy mother shall think it,
POEM	And thou no worse | than ever it was."
POEM	
POEM	29. Beer he brought, | he was better in cunning,
POEM	Until in her seat | full soon she slept.
POEM	
POEM	Völund spake:
POEM	Now vengeance I have | for all my hurts,
POEM	Save one alone, | on the evil woman.
POEM	
POEM	30. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Quoth Völund: "Would | that well were the sinews
POEM	Maimed in my feet | by Nithuth's men."
POEM	
POEM	31. Laughing Völund | rose aloft,
POEM	Weeping Bothvild | went from the isle,
POEM	For her lover's flight | and her father's wrath.
POEM	
POEM	32. Without stood the wife | of Nithuth wise,
POEM	And in she came | from the end of the hall;
POEM	But he by the wall | in weariness sat:
POEM	Wakest thou, Nithuth, | lord of the Njars?
POEM	
POEM	Nithuth spake:
POEM	33. "Always I wake, | and ever joyless,
POEM	Little I sleep | since my sons were slain;
POEM	Cold is my head, | cold was thy counsel,
POEM	One thing, with Völund | to speak, I wish.
POEM	
POEM	34. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Answer me, Völund, | greatest of elves,
POEM	What happed with my boys | that hale once were?
POEM	
POEM	Völund spake:
POEM	35. "First shalt thou all | the oaths now swear,
POEM	By the rail of ship, | and the rim of shield,
POEM	By the shoulder of steed, | and the edge of sword,
POEM	That to Völund's wife | thou wilt work no ill,
POEM	Nor yet my bride | to her death wilt bring,
POEM	Though a wife I should have | that well thou knowest,
POEM	And a child I should have | within thy hall.
POEM	
POEM	36. "Seek the smithy | that thou didst set,
POEM	Thou shalt find the bellows | sprinkled with blood;
POEM	I smote off the heads | of both thy sons,
POEM	And their feet 'neath the sooty | straps I hid.
POEM	
POEM	37. "Their skulls, once hid | by their hair, I took,
POEM	Set them in silver | and sent them to Nithuth;
POEM	Gems full fair | from their eyes I fashioned,
POEM	To Nithuth's wife | so wise I gave them.
POEM	
POEM	38. "And from the teeth | of the twain I wrought
POEM	A brooch for the breast, | to Bothvild I gave it;
POEM	Now big with child | does Bothvild go,
POEM	The only daughter | ye two had ever."
POEM	
POEM	Nithuth spake:
POEM	39. "Never spakest thou word | that worse could hurt me,
POEM	Nor that made me, Völund, | more bitter for vengeance;
POEM	There is no man so high | from thy horse to take thee,
POEM	Or so doughty an archer | as down to shoot thee,
POEM	While high in the clouds | thy course thou takest."
POEM	
POEM	40. Laughing Völund | rose aloft,
POEM	But left in sadness | Nithuth sat.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	41. Then spake Nithuth, | lord of the Njars:
POEM	Rise up, Thakkrath, | best of my thralls,
POEM	Bid Bothvild come, | the bright-browed maid,
POEM	Bedecked so fair, | with her father to speak.
POEM	
POEM	42. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Is it true, Bothvild, | that which was told me;
POEM	Once in the isle | with Völund wert thou?
POEM	
POEM	Bothvild spake:
POEM	43. "True is it, Nithuth, | that which was told thee,
POEM	Once in the isle | with Völund was I,
POEM	An hour of lust, | alas it should be!
POEM	Nought was my might | with such a man,
POEM	Nor from his strength | could I save myself."
TITLE	HELGAKVITHA HJORVARTHSSONAR
SUBTITLE	The Lay of Helgi the Son of Hjorvarth
POEM	1. "Sawest thou Sigrlin, | Svafnir's daughter,
POEM	The fairest maid | in her home-land found?
POEM	Though Hjorvath's wives | by men are held
POEM	Goodly to see | in Glasir's wood."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	2. "Now with Atli, | Ithmund's son,
POEM	Wilt thou say more, | thou bird so wise?"
POEM	
POEM	The bird spake:
POEM	I may if the prince | an offering makes,
POEM	And I have what I will | from the house of the king.
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	3. "Choose not Hjorvarth, | nor sons of his,
POEM	Nor the wives so fair | of the famous chief;
POEM	Ask not the brides | that the prince's are;
POEM	Fair let us deal | in friendly wise."
POEM	
POEM	The bird spake:
POEM	4. "A fane will I ask, | and altars many,
POEM	Gold-horned cattle | the prince shall give me,
POEM	If Sigrlin yet | shall sleep in his arms,
POEM	Or free of will | the hero shall follow."
POEM	This was before Atli went on his journey; but when he came home, and the king asked his tidings, he
POEM	said:
POEM	
POEM	5. "Trouble we had, | but tidings none,
POEM	Our horses failed | in the mountains high,
POEM	The waters of Sæmorn | we needs must wade;
POEM	Svafnir's daughter, | with rings bedecked,
POEM	She whom we sought, | was still denied us."
POEM	The king bade that they should go another time, and he went with them himself, But when they came up
POEM	on the mountain, they saw Svavaland burning and mighty dust-clouds from many steeds. The king rode
POEM	from the mountain forward into the land, and made a night's stay hard by a stream. Atli kept watch and
POEM	went over the stream; he found there a house. A great bird sat on the housetop to guard it, but he was
POEM	asleep. Atli hurled his spear at the bird and slew it, and in the house he found Sigrlin the king's daughter
POEM	and Alof the jarl's daughter, and he brought them both thence with him. Jarl Franmar had changed
POEM	himself into the likeness of an eagle, and guarded them from the enemy host by magic. Hrothmar was the
POEM	name of a king, a wooer of Sigrlin; he slew the
POEM	king of Svavaland and had plundered and burned his land. King Hjorvarth took Sigrlin, and Atli took
POEM	Alof.
POEM	(II)
POEM	Hjorvarth and Sigrlin had a son, mighty and of noble stature; he was a silent man, and no name stuck fast
POEM	
POEM	to him. He sat on a hill, and saw nine Valkyries riding; one of them was the fairest of all. She spake:
POEM	6. "Late wilt thou, Helgi, | have hoard of rings,
POEM	Thou battle-tree fierce, | or of shining fields,--
POEM	The eagle screams soon,-- | if never thou speakest,
POEM	Though, hero, hard | thy heart may cry."
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	7. "What gift shall I have | with Helgi's name,
POEM	Glorious maid, | for the giving is thine?
POEM	All thy words | shall I think on well,
POEM	But I want them not | if I win not thee."
POEM	
POEM	The Valkyrie spake:
POEM	8. "Swords I know lying | in Sigarsholm,
POEM	Fifty there are | save only four;
POEM	One there is | that is best of all,
POEM	The shield-destroyer, | with gold it shines.
POEM	
POEM	9. "In the hilt is fame, | in the haft is courage,
POEM	In the point is fear, | for its owner's foes;
POEM	On the blade there lies | a blood-flecked snake,
POEM	And a serpent's tail | round the flat is twisted."
POEM	Eylimi was the name of a king, whose daughter was Svava; she was a Valkyrie, and rode air and sea. She
POEM	
POEM	gave Helgi this name, and shielded him oft thereafter in battle. Helgi spake:
POEM	10. "Hjorvarth, king, | unwholesome thy counsels,
POEM	Though famed thou art | in leading the folk,
POEM	Letting fire the homes of heroes eat,
POEM	Who evil deed had never done thee.
POEM	
POEM	11. "Yet Hrothmar still the hoard doth hold,
POEM	The wealth that once our kinsmen wielded;
POEM	Full seldom care the king disturbs,
POEM	Heir to dead men he deems himself."
POEM	Hjorvarth answered that he would give Helgi a following if he fain would avenge his mother's father.
POEM	Then Helgi got the sword that Svava had told him of. So he went, and Atli with him, and they slew
POEM	Hrothmar, and they did many great deeds.
POEM	(III)
POEM	He slew the giant Hati, whom he found sitting on a certain mountain. Helgi and Atli lay with their ships
POEM	
POEM	in Hatafjord. Atli kept watch during the first part of the night. Hrimgerth, Hati's daughter, spake:
POEM	12. "Who are the heroes | in Hatafjord?
POEM	The ships are covered with shields;
POEM	Bravely ye look, | and little ye fear,
POEM	The name of the king would I know."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	13. "Helgi his name, | and never thou mayst
POEM	Harm to the hero bring;
POEM	With iron is fitted | the prince's fleet,
POEM	Nor can witches work us ill."
POEM	
POEM	Hrimgerth spake:
POEM	14. "Who now, thou mighty | man, art thou?
POEM	By what name art thou known to men?
POEM	He trusts thee well, | the prince who wills
POEM	That thou stand at the stem of his ship."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	15. "Atli am I, | and ill shalt thou find me,
POEM	Great hate for witches I have;
POEM	Oft have I been | in the dripping bows,
POEM	And to dusk-riders death have brought.
POEM	
POEM	16. "Corpse-hungry giantess, | how art thou called?
POEM	Say, witch, who thy father was!
POEM	Nine miles deeper | down mayst thou sink,
POEM	And a tree grow tall on thy bosom."
POEM	
POEM	Hrimgerth spake:
POEM	17. "Hrimgerth am I, | my father was Hati,
POEM	Of giants the most in might;
POEM	Many a woman | he won from her home,
POEM	Ere Helgi hewed him down."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	18. "Witch, in front | of the ship thou wast,
POEM	And lay before the fjord;
POEM	To Ron wouldst have given | the ruler's men,
POEM	If a spear had not stuck in thy flesh."
POEM	
POEM	Hrimgerth spake:
POEM	19. "Dull art thou, Atli, | thou dreamest, methinks,
POEM	The lids lie over thine eyes;
POEM	By the leader's ships | my mother lay,
POEM	Hlothvarth's sons on the sea I slew.
POEM	
POEM	20. "Thou wouldst neigh, Atli, | but gelded thou art,
POEM	See, Hrimgerth hoists her tail;
POEM	In thy hinder end | is thy heart, methinks,
POEM	Though thy speech is a stallion's cry."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	21. "A stallion I seem | if thou seekest to try me,
POEM	And I leap to land from the sea;
POEM	I shall smite thee to bits, | if so I will,
POEM	And heavy sinks Hrimgerth's tail."
POEM	
POEM	Hrimgerth spake:
POEM	22. "Go ashore then, Atli, | if sure of thy might,
POEM	Let us come to Varin's cove;
POEM	Straight shall thy rounded | ribs be made
POEM	If thou comest within my claws."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	23. "I will not go | till the warriors wake,
POEM	Again their chief to guard;
POEM	I should wonder not, | foul witch, if up
POEM	From beneath our keel thou shouldst come."
POEM	
POEM	Hrimgerth spake:
POEM	24. "Awake now, Helgi, | and Hrimgerth requite,
POEM	That Hati to death thou didst hew;
POEM	If a single night | she can sleep by the prince,
POEM	Then requited are all her ills."
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	25. " 'Tis Lothin shall have thee,-- | thou'rt loathsome to men,--
POEM	His home in Tholley he has;
POEM	Of the wild-dwellers worst | is the giant wise,
POEM	He is meet as a mate for thee."
POEM	
POEM	Hrimgerth spake:
POEM	26. "More thou lovest her | who scanned the harbor,
POEM	Last night among the men;
POEM	(The gold-decked maid | bore magic, rnethinks,
POEM	When the land from the sea she sought,
POEM	And fast she kept your fleet;)
POEM	She alone is to blame | that I may not bring
POEM	Death to the monarch's men."
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	27. "Hrimgerth, mark, | if thy hurts I requite,
POEM	Tell now the truth to the king;
POEM	Was there one who the ships | of the warrior warded,
POEM	Or did many together go?"
POEM	
POEM	Hrimgerth spake:
POEM	28. "Thrice nine there were, | but one rode first,
POEM	A helmed maid white of hue;
POEM	Their horses quivered, | there came from their manes
POEM	Dew in the dales so deep,
POEM	(Hail on the woods so high,
POEM	Thence men their harvest have,
POEM	But ill was the sight I saw.)"
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	29. "Look eastward, Hrimgerth, | for Helgi has struck thee
POEM	Down with the runes of death;
POEM	Safe in harbor floats | the prince's fleet,
POEM	And safe are the monarch's men."
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	30. "It is day, Hrimgerth, | for Atli held thee
POEM	Till now thy life thou must lose;
POEM	As a harbor mark | men shall mock at thee,
POEM	Where in stone thou shalt ever stand."
POEM	(IV)
POEM	King Helgi was a mighty warrior. He came to King Eylimi and sought the hand of his daughter, Svava.
POEM	Then Helgi and Svava exchanged vows, and greatly they loved each other. Svava was at home with her
POEM	father, while Helgi was in the field; Svava was still a Valkyrie as before.
POEM	Hethin was at home with his father, King Hjorvarth, in Norway. Hethin was coming home alone from the
POEM	forest one Yule-eve, and found a troll-woman; she rode
POEM	on a wolf, and had snakes in place of a bridle. She asked Hethin for his company. "Nay," said he. She
POEM	said, "Thou shalt pay for this at the king's toast." That evening the great vows were taken; the sacred boar
POEM	was brought in, the men laid their hands thereon, and took their vows at the king's toast. Hethin vowed
POEM	that he would have Svava, Eylimi's daughter, the beloved of his brother Helgi; then such great grief
POEM	seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land, and found Helgi, his brother. Helgi
POEM	said:
POEM	3 1. "Welcome, Hethin! | what hast thou to tell
POEM	Of tidings new | that from Norway come?
POEM	Wherefore didst leave | thy land, O prince,
POEM	And fared alone | to find us here?"
POEM	
POEM	Hethin spake:
POEM	32. "A deed more evil | I have done
POEM	Than, brother mine, | thou e'er canst mend;
POEM	For I have chosen | the child of the king,
POEM	Thy bride, for mine | at the monarch's toast."
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	33. "Grieve not, Hethin, | for true shall hold
POEM	The words we both | by the beer have sworn;
POEM	To the isle a warrior | wills that I go,
POEM	(There shall I come | the third night hence;)
POEM	And doubtful must be | my coming back,
POEM	(So may all be well, | if fate so wills.)"
POEM	
POEM	Hethin spake:
POEM	34. "Thou saidst once, Helgi, | that Hethin was
POEM	A friend full good, | and gifts didst give him;
POEM	More seemly it were | thy sword to redden,
POEM	Than friendship thus | to thy foe to-give."
POEM	Helgi spoke thus because he foresaw his death, for his following-spirits had met Hethin when he saw the
POEM	woman riding on the wolf. Alf was the name of a king, the son of Hrothmar, who had marked out a
POEM	battle-place with
POEM	
POEM	Helgi at Sigarsvoll after a stay of three nights. Then Helgi spake:
POEM	35. "On a wolf there rode, | when dusk it was,
POEM	A woman who fain | would have him follow;
POEM	Well she knew | that now would fall
POEM	Sigrlin's son | at Sigarsvoll."
POEM	There was a great battle, and there Helgi got a mortal wound.
POEM	
POEM	36. Sigar riding | did Helgi send
POEM	To seek out Eylimi's | only daughter:
POEM	Bid her swiftly | ready to be,
POEM	If her lover | alive she would find.
POEM	
POEM	Sigar spake:
POEM	37. "Hither now | has Helgi sent me,
POEM	With thee, Svava, | thyself to speak;
POEM	The hero said | he fain would see thee
POEM	Ere life the nobly | born should leave."
POEM	
POEM	Svava spake:
POEM	A "What chanced with Helgi, | Hjorvarth's son?
POEM	Hard to me | is harm now come;
POEM	If the sea smote him, | or sword bit him,
POEM	Ill shall I bring | to all his foes."
POEM	
POEM	Sigar spake:
POEM	39. "In the morn he fell | at Frekastein,
POEM	The king who was noblest | beneath the sun;
POEM	Alf has the joy | of victory all,
POEM	Though need therefor | is never his."
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	40. "Hail to thee, Svava! | thy sorrow rule,
POEM	Our meeting last | in life is this;
POEM	Hard the wounds | of the hero bleed,
POEM	And close to my heart | the sword has come.
POEM	
POEM	41. "I bid thee, Svava,-- | weep not, bride,--
POEM	If thou wilt hearken | to these my words,
POEM	The bed for Hethin | have thou ready,
POEM	And yield thy love | to the hero young."
POEM	
POEM	Svava spake:
POEM	42. "A vow I had | in my dear-loved home,
POEM	When Helgi sought | with rings to have me,
POEM	That not of my will, | if the warrior died,
POEM	Would I fold in my arms | a man unfamed."
POEM	
POEM	Hethin spake:
POEM	43. "Kiss me, Svava, | I come not back,
POEM	Rogheim to see, | or Rothulsfjoll,
POEM	Till vengeance I have | for the son of Hjorvarth,
POEM	The king who was noblest | beneath the sun."
POEM	Of Helgi and Svava it is said that they were born again.
TITLE	HELGAKVITHA HUNDINGSBANA I
SUBTITLE	The First Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane
POEM	1. In olden days, | when eagles screamed,
POEM	And holy streams | from heaven's crags fell,
POEM	Was Helgi then, | the hero-hearted,
POEM	Borghild's son, | in Bralund born.
POEM	
POEM	2. 'Twas night in the dwelling, | and Norns there came,
POEM	Who shaped the life | of the lofty one;
POEM	They bade him most famed | of fighters all
POEM	And best of princes | ever to be.
POEM	
POEM	3. Mightily wove they | the web of fate,
POEM	While Bralund's towns | were trembling all;
POEM	And there the golden | threads they wove,
POEM	And in the moon's hall | fast they made them.
POEM	
POEM	4. East and west | the ends they hid,
POEM	In the middle the hero | should have his land;
POEM	And Neri's kinswoman | northward cast
POEM	A chain, and bade it | firm ever to be.
POEM	
POEM	5. Once sorrow had | the Ylfings' son,
POEM	And grief the bride | who the loved one had borne.
POEM	* * * * * *
POEM	Quoth raven to raven, | on treetop resting,
POEM	Seeking for food, | "There is something I know.
POEM	
POEM	6. "In mail-coat stands | the son of Sigmund,
POEM	A half-day old; | now day is here;
POEM	His eyes flash sharp | as the heroes' are,
POEM	He is friend of the wolves; | full glad are we."
POEM	
POEM	7. The warrior throng | a ruler thought him,
POEM	Good times, they said, | mankind should see;
POEM	The king himself | from battle-press came,
POEM	To give the prince | a leek full proud.
POEM	
POEM	8. Helgi he named him, | and Hringstathir gave him,
POEM	Solfjoll, Snæfjoll, | and Sigarsvoll,
POEM	Hringstoth, Hotun, | and Himinvangar,
POEM	And a blood-snake bedecked | to Sinfjotli's brother.
POEM	
POEM	9. Mighty he grew | in the midst of his friends,
POEM	The fair-born elm, | in fortune's glow;
POEM	To his comrades gold | he gladly gave,
POEM	The hero spared not | the blood-flecked hoard.
POEM	
POEM	10. Short time for war | the chieftain waited,
POEM	When fifteen winters | old he was;
POEM	Hunding he slew, | the hardy wight
POEM	Who long had ruled | o'er lands and men.
POEM	
POEM	11. Of Sigmund's son | then next they sought
POEM	Hoard and rings, | the sons of Hunding;
POEM	They bade the prince | requital pay
POEM	For booty stolen | and father slain.
POEM	
POEM	12. The prince let not | their prayers avail,
POEM	Nor gold for their dead | did the kinsmen get;
POEM	Waiting, he said, | was a mighty storm
POEM	Of lances gray | and Othin's grimness.
POEM	
POEM	13. The warriors forth | to the battle went,
POEM	The field they chose | at Logafjoll;
POEM	Frothi's peace | midst foes they broke,
POEM	Through the isle went hungrily | Vithrir's hounds.
POEM	
POEM	14. The king then sat, | when he had slain
POEM	Eyjolf and Alf, | 'neath the eagle-stone;
POEM	Hjorvarth and Hovarth, | Hunding's sons,
POEM	The kin of the spear-wielder, | all had he killed.
POEM	
POEM	15. Then glittered light | from Logafjoll,
POEM	And from the light | the flashes leaped;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	16. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	High under helms | on heaven's field;
POEM	Their byrnies all | with blood were red,
POEM	And from their spears | the sparks flew forth.
POEM	
POEM	17. Early then | in wolf-wood asked
POEM	The mighty king | of the southern maid,
POEM	If with the hero | home would she
POEM	Come that night; | the weapons clashed.
POEM	
POEM	18. Down from her horse | sprang Hogni's daughter,--
POEM	
POEM	The shields were still,-- | and spake to the hero:
POEM	Other tasks | are ours, methinks,
POEM	Than drinking beer | with the breaker of rings.
POEM	
POEM	19. My father has pledged | his daughter fair
POEM	As bride to Granmar's | son so grim;
POEM	But, Helgi, I | once Hothbrodd called
POEM	As fine a king | as the son of a cat.
POEM	
POEM	20. "Yet the hero will come | a few nights hence,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Unless thou dost bid him | the battle-ground seek,
POEM	Or takest the maid | from the warrior mighty."
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	21. "Fear him not, | though Isung he felled,
POEM	First must our courage | keen be tried,
POEM	Before unwilling | thou fare with the knave;
POEM	Weapons will clash, | if to death I come not."
POEM	
POEM	22. Messengers sent | the mighty one then,
POEM	By land and by sea, | a host to seek,
POEM	Store of wealth | of the water's gleam,
POEM	And men to summon, | and sons of men.
POEM	
POEM	23. "Bid them straightway | seek the ships,
POEM	And off Brandey | ready to be!"
POEM	There the chief waited | till thither were come
POEM	Men by hundreds | from Hethinsey.
POEM	
POEM	24. Soon off Stafnsnes | stood the ships,
POEM	Fair they glided | and gay with gold;
POEM	
POEM	Then Helgi spake | to Hjorleif asking:
POEM	Hast thou counted | the gallant host?
POEM	
POEM	25. The young king answered | the other then:
POEM	Long were it to tell | from Tronueyr
POEM	The long-stemmed ships | with warriors laden
POEM	That come from without | into Orvasund.
POEM	
POEM	26. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	There are hundreds twelve | of trusty men,
POEM	But in Hotun lies | the host of the king,
POEM	Greater by half; | I have hope of battle."
POEM	
POEM	27. The ship's-tents soon | the chieftain struck,
POEM	And waked the throng | of warriors all;
POEM	(The heroes the red | of dawn beheld;)
POEM	And on the masts | the gallant men
POEM	Made fast the sails | in Varinsfjord.
POEM	
POEM	28. There was beat of oars | and clash of iron,
POEM	Shield smote shield | as the ships'-folk rowed;
POEM	Swiftly went | the warrior-laden
POEM	Fleet of the ruler | forth from the land.
POEM	
POEM	29. So did it sound, | when together the sisters
POEM	Of Kolga struck | with the keels full long,
POEM	As if cliffs were broken | with beating surf,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	30. Helgi bade higher | hoist the sails,
POEM	Nor did the ships'-folk | shun the waves,
POEM	Though dreadfully | did Ægir's daughters
POEM	Seek the steeds | of the sea to sink.
POEM	
POEM	31. But from above | did Sigrun brave
POEM	Aid the men and | all their faring;
POEM	Mightily came | from the claws of Ron
POEM	The leader's sea-beast | off Gnipalund.
POEM	
POEM	32. At evening there | in Unavagar
POEM	Floated the fleet | bedecked full fair;
POEM	But they who saw | from Svarin's hill,
POEM	Bitter at heart | the host beheld.
POEM	
POEM	33. Then Gothmund asked, | goodly of birth,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Who is the monarch | who guides the host,
POEM	And to the land | the warriors leads?
POEM	
POEM	34. Sinfjotli answered, | and up on an oar
POEM	Raised a shield all red | with golden rim;
POEM	A sea-sentry was he, | skilled to speak,
POEM	And in words with princes | well to strive.
POEM	
POEM	35. "Say tonight | when you feed the swine,
POEM	And send your bitches | to seek their swill,
POEM	That out of the East | have the Ylfings come,
POEM	Greedy for battle, | to Gnipalund.
POEM	
POEM	36. "There will Hothbrodd | Helgi find,
POEM	In the midst of the fleet, | and flight he scorns;
POEM	Often has he | the eagles gorged,
POEM	Whilst thou at the quern | wert slave-girls kissing."
POEM	
POEM	Gothmund spake:
POEM	37. "Hero, the ancient | sayings heed,
POEM	And bring not lies | to the nobly born.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	38. "Thou hast eaten | the entrails of wolves,
POEM	And of thy brothers | the slayer been;
POEM	Oft wounds to suck | thy cold mouth sought,
POEM	And loathed in rocky | dens didst lurk."
POEM	
POEM	Sinfjotli spake:
POEM	39. "A witch in Varin's | isle thou wast,
POEM	A woman false, | and lies didst fashion;
POEM	Of the mail-clad heroes | thou wouldst have
POEM	No other, thou saidst, | save Sinfjotli only.
POEM	
POEM	40. "A Valkyrie wast thou, | loathly Witch,
POEM	Evil and base, | in Allfather's home;
POEM	The warriors all | must ever fight,
POEM	Woman subtle, | for sake of thee.
POEM	
POEM	41. ". . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Nine did we | in Sogunes
POEM	Of wolf-cubs have; | I their father was."
POEM	
POEM	Gothmund spake:
POEM	42. "Thou didst not father | Fenrir's-wolves,
POEM	Though older thou art | than all I know;
POEM	For they gelded thee | in Gnipalund,
POEM	The giant-women | at Thorsnes once.
POEM	
POEM	43. "Under houses the stepson | of Siggeir lay,
POEM	Fain of the wolf's cry | out in the woods;
POEM	Evil came then all | to thy hands,
POEM	When thy brothers' | breasts thou didst redden,
POEM	Fame didst thou win | for foulest deeds.
POEM	
POEM	44. "In Bravoll wast thou | Grani's bride,
POEM	Golden-bitted | and ready to gallop;
POEM	I rode thee many | a mile, and down
POEM	Didst sink, thou giantess, | under the saddle."
POEM	
POEM	Sinfjotli spake:
POEM	45. "A brainless fellow | didst seem to be,
POEM	When once for Gollnir | goats didst milk,
POEM	And another time | when as Imth's daughter
POEM	In rags thou wentest; | wilt longer wrangle?"
POEM	
POEM	Gothmund spake:
POEM	46. "Sooner would I | at Frekastein
POEM	Feed the ravens | with flesh of thine
POEM	Than send your bitches | to seek their swill,
POEM	Or feed the swine; | may the fiends take you!"
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	47. "Better, Sinfjotli, | thee 'twould beseem
POEM	Battle to give | and eagles to gladden,
POEM	Than vain and empty | words to utter,
POEM	Though ring-breakers oft | in speech do wrangle.
POEM	
POEM	48. "Good I find not | the sons of Granmar,
POEM	But for heroes 'tis seemly | the truth to speak;
POEM	At Moinsheimar | proved the men
POEM	That hearts for the wielding | of swords they had."
POEM	
POEM	49. Mightily then | they made to run
POEM	Sviputh and Sveggjuth | to Solheimar;
POEM	(By dewy dales | and chasms dark,
POEM	Mist's horse shook | where the men went by;)
POEM	The king they found | at his courtyard gate,
POEM	And told him the foeman | fierce was come.
POEM	
POEM	50. Forth stood Hothbrodd, | helmed for battle,
POEM	Watched the riding | of his warriors;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Why are the Hniflungs | white with fear?
POEM	
POEM	Gothmund spake:
POEM	51. "Swift keels lie | hard by the land,
POEM	(Mast-ring harts | and mighty yards,
POEM	Wealth of shields | and well-planed oars;)
POEM	The king's fair host, | the Ylfings haughty;
POEM	Fifteen bands | to land have fared,
POEM	But out in Sogn | are seven thousand.
POEM	
POEM	52. "At anchor lying | off Gnipalund
POEM	Are fire-beasts black, | all fitted with gold;
POEM	There wait most | of the foeman's men,
POEM	Nor will Helgi long | the battle delay."
POEM	
POEM	Hothbrodd spake:
POEM	53. "Bid the horses run | to the Reginthing,
POEM	Melnir and Mylnir | to Myrkwood now,
POEM	(And Sporvitnir | to Sparinsheith;)
POEM	Let no man seek | henceforth to sit
POEM	Who the flame of wounds | knows well to wield.
POEM	
POEM	54. "Summon Hogni, | the sons of Hring,
POEM	Atli and Yngvi | and Alf the Old;
POEM	Glad they are | of battle ever;
POEM	Against the Volsungs | let us go."
POEM	
POEM	55. Swift as a storm | there smote together
POEM	The flashing blades | at Frekastein;
POEM	Ever was Helgi, | Hunding's slayer,
POEM	First in the throng | where warriors fought;
POEM	(Fierce in battle, | slow to fly,
POEM	Hard the heart | of the hero was.)
POEM	
POEM	56. From heaven there came | the maidens helmed,--
POEM	The weapon-clang grew,-- | who watched o'er the king;
POEM	Spake Sigrun fair,-- | the wound-givers flew,
POEM	And the horse of the giantess | raven's-food had:--
POEM	
POEM	57. "Hail to thee, hero! | full happy with men,
POEM	Offspring of Yngvi, | shalt ever live,
POEM	For thou the fearless | foe hast slain
POEM	Who to many the dread | of death had brought.
POEM	
POEM	58. "Warrior, well | for thyself hast won
POEM	Red rings bright | and the noble bride;
POEM	Both now, warrior, | thine shall be,
POEM	Hogni's daughter | and Hringstathir,
POEM	Wealth and triumph; | the battle wanes."
TITLE	HELGAKVITHA HUNDINGSBANA II
SUBTITLE	The Second Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane
POEM	1. "Say to Hæming | that Helgi knows
POEM	Whom the heroes | in armor hid;
POEM	A gray wolf had they | within their hall,
POEM	Whom King Hunding | Hamal thought."
POEM	Hamal was the name of Hagal's son. King Hunding
POEM	sent men to Hagal to seek Helgi, and Helgi could not save himself in any other way, so he put on the
POEM	clothes of a bond-woman and set to work at the mill. They sought Helgi but found him not.
POEM	
POEM	2. Then Blind spake out, | the evil-minded:
POEM	 Of Hagal's bond-woman | bright are the eyes;
POEM	Yon comes not of churls | who stands at the quern;
POEM	The millstones break, | the boards are shattered.
POEM	
POEM	3. The hero has | a doom full hard,
POEM	That barley now | he needs must grind;
POEM	Better befits | his hand to feel
POEM	The hilt of the sword | than the millstone's handle."
POEM	Hagal answered and said:
POEM	
POEM	4. "Small is the wonder | if boards are splintered
POEM	By a monarch's daughter | the mill is turned;
POEM	Once through clouds | she was wont to ride,
POEM	And battles fought | like fighting men,
POEM	(Till Helgi a captive | held her fast;
POEM	Sister she is | of Sigar and Hogni,
POEM	Thus bright are the eyes | of the Ylfings' maid.)"
POEM	Helgi escaped and went to a fighting ship. He slew King Hunding, and thenceforth was called Helgi
POEM	Hundingsbane.
POEM	(II)
POEM	He lay with his host in Brunavagar, and they had there a strand-slaughtering, and ate the flesh raw. Hogni
POEM	was the name of a king. His daughter was Sigrun; she was a Valkyrie and rode air and water; she was
POEM	Svava reborn. Sigrun rode to Helgi's ship and said:
POEM	
POEM	5. "Who rules the ship | by the shore so steep?
POEM	Where is the home | ye warriors have?
POEM	Why do ye bide | in Brunavagar,
POEM	Or what the way | that ye wish to try?"
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	6 "Hamal's the ship | by the shore so steep,
POEM	Our home in Hlesey | do we have;
POEM	For fair wind bide we | in Brunavagar,
POEM	Eastward the way | that we wish to try."
POEM	
POEM	Sigrun spake:
POEM	7. "Where hast thou, warrior, | battle wakened,
POEM	Or gorged the birds | of the sisters of Guth?
POEM	Why is thy byrnie | spattered with blood,
POEM	Why helmed dost feast | on food uncooked?"
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	8. "Latest of all, | the Ylfings' son
POEM	On the western sea, | if know thou wilt,
POEM	Captured bears | in Bragalund,
POEM	And fed the eagles | with edge of sword.
POEM	Now is it shown | why our shirts are bloody,
POEM	And little our food | with fire is cooked."
POEM	
POEM	Sigrun spake:
POEM	9. "Of battle thou tellest, | and there was bent
POEM	Hunding the king | before Helgi down;
POEM	There was carnage when thou | didst avenge thy kin,
POEM	And blood flowed fast | on the blade of the sword."
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	10. "How didst thou know | that now our kin,
POEM	Maiden wise, | we have well avenged?
POEM	Many there are | of the sons of the mighty
POEM	Who share alike | our lofty race."
POEM	
POEM	Sigrun spake:
POEM	11. "Not far was I | from the lord of the folk,
POEM	Yester morn, | when the monarch was slain;
POEM	Though crafty the son | of Sigmund, methinks,
POEM	When he speaks of the fight | in slaughter-runes.
POEM	
POEM	12. "On the long-ship once | I saw thee well,
POEM	When in the blood-stained | bow thou wast,
POEM	(And round thee icy | waves were raging;)
POEM	Now would the hero | hide from me,
POEM	But to Hogni's daughter | is Helgi known."
POEM	(III)
POEM	Granmar was the name of a mighty king, who dwelt at Svarin's hill. He had many sons; one was named
POEM	Hothbrodd, another Gothmund, a third Starkath. Hothbrodd was in a kings' meeting, and he won the
POEM	promise of having Sigrun, Hogni's daughter, for his wife. But when she heard this, she rode with the
POEM	Valkyries over air and sea to seek Helgi. Helgi was then at Logafjoll, and had fought with Hunding's
POEM	sons; there he killed Alf and Eyolf, Hjorvarth and Hervarth. He was all weary with battle, and sat under
POEM	the eagle-stone. There Sigrun found him, and ran to throw her arms about his neck, and kissed him, and
POEM	told him her tidings, as is set forth in the old Volsung lay:
POEM	
POEM	13. Sigrun the joyful | chieftain sought,
POEM	Forthwith Helgi's | hand she took;
POEM	She greeted the hero | helmed and kissed him,
POEM	The warrior's heart | to the woman turned.
POEM	
POEM	14. From her heart the daughter | of Hogni spake,
POEM	Dear was Helgi, | she said, to her;
POEM	Long with all | my heart I loved
POEM	Sigmund's son | ere ever I saw him.
POEM	
POEM	15. At the meeting to Hothbrodd | mated I was,
POEM	But another hero | I fain would have;
POEM	Though, king, the wrath | of my kin I fear,
POEM	Since I broke my father's | fairest wish."
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	16. "Fear not ever | Hogni's anger,
POEM	Nor yet thy kinsmen's | cruel wrath;
POEM	Maiden, thou | with me shalt live,
POEM	Thy kindred, fair one, | I shall not fear."
POEM	(IV)
POEM	Helgi then assembled a great sea-host and went to Frekastein. On the sea he met a perilous storm;
POEM	lightning flashed overhead and the bolts struck the ship. They saw in the air that nine Valkyries were
POEM	riding, and recognized Sigrun among them. Then the storm abated, and they came safe and sound to land.
POEM	Granmar's sons sat on a certain mountain as the ships sailed toward the land. Gothmund leaped on a
POEM	horse and rode for news to a promontory near the harbor; the Volsungs were even then lowering their
POEM	sails. Then Gothmund said, as is written before in the Helgi lay:
POEM	Who is the king | who captains the fleet,
POEM	And to the land | the warriors leads?
POEM	Sinfjotli, Sigmund's son, answered him, and that too is written.
POEM	Gothmund rode home with his tidings of the host;
POEM	then Granmar's sons summoned an army. Many kings came there; there were Hogni, Sigrun's father, and
POEM	his sons Bragi and Dag. There was a great battle, and all Granmar's sons were slain and all their allies;
POEM	only Dag, Hogni's son, was spared, and he swore loyalty to the Volsungs. Sigrun went among the dead
POEM	and found Hothbrodd at the coming of death. She said:
POEM	
POEM	17. "Never shall Sigrun | from Sevafjoll,
POEM	Hothbrodd king, | be held in thine arms;
POEM	Granmar's sons | full cold have grown,
POEM	And the giant-steeds gray | on corpses gorge."
POEM	Then she sought out Helgi, and was full of joy He said:
POEM	
POEM	18. "Maid, not fair | is all thy fortune,
POEM	The Norris I blame | that this should be;
POEM	This morn there fell | at Frekastein
POEM	Bragi and Hogni | beneath my hand.
POEM	
POEM	19. "At Hlebjorg fell | the sons of Hrollaug,
POEM	Starkath the king | at Styrkleifar;
POEM	Fighters more noble | saw I never,
POEM	The body fought | when the head had fallen.
POEM	
POEM	20. "On the ground full low | the slain are lying,
POEM	Most are there | of the men of thy race;
POEM	Nought hast thou won, | for thy fate it was
POEM	Brave men to bring | to the battle-field."
POEM	Then Sigrun wept. | Helgi said:
POEM	
POEM	21. "Grieve not, Sigrun, | the battle is gained,
POEM	The fighter can shun not his fate."
POEM	
POEM	Sigrun spake:
POEM	To life would I call | them who slaughtered lie,
POEM	If safe on thy breast I might be.
POEM	(V)
POEM	This Gothmund the son of Granmar spoke:
POEM	
POEM	22. "What hero great | is guiding the ships?
POEM	A golden flag | on the stem he flies;
POEM	I find not peace in | the van of your faring,
POEM	And round the fighters | is battle-light red."
POEM	
POEM	Sinfjotli spake:
POEM	23. "Here may Hothbrodd | Helgi find,
POEM	The hater of flight, | in the midst of the fleet;
POEM	The home of all | thy race he has,
POEM	And over the realm | of the fishes he rules."
POEM	
POEM	Gothmund spake:
POEM	24. "First shall swords | at Frekastein
POEM	Prove our worth | in place of words;
POEM	Time is it, Hothbrodd, | vengeance to have,
POEM	If in battle worsted | once we were."
POEM	
POEM	Sinfjotli spake:
POEM	25. "Better, Gothmund, | to tend the goats,
POEM	And climb the rocks | of the mountain cliffs;
POEM	A hazel switch | to hold in thy hand
POEM	More seemly were | than the hilt of a sword."
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	26. "Better, Sinfjotli, | thee 'twould beseem
POEM	Battles to give, | and eagles to gladden,
POEM	Than vain and empty | speech to utter,
POEM	Though warriors oft | with words do strive.
POEM	
POEM	27. "Good I find not | the sons of Granmar,
POEM	But for heroes 'tis seemly | the truth to speak;
POEM	At Moinsheimar | proved the men
POEM	That hearts for the wielding | of swords they had,
POEM	(And ever brave | the warriors are.)"
POEM	(VI)
POEM	Helgi took Sigrun to wife, and they had sons. Helgi did not reach old age. Dag, the son of Hogni, offered
POEM	sacrifice to Othin to be avenged for his father's death; Othin gave Dag his spear. Dag found Helgi, his
POEM	brother-in-law, at a place which is called Fjoturlund. He thrust the spear through Helgi's body. Then
POEM	Helgi fell, and Dag rode to Sevafjoll and told Sigrun the tidings:
POEM	
POEM	28. "Sad am I, sister, | sorrow to tell thee,
POEM	Woe to my kin | unwilling I worked;
POEM	In the morn there fell | at Fjoturlund
POEM	The noblest prince | the world has known,
POEM	(And his heel he set | on the heroes' necks.)"
POEM	
POEM	Sigrun spake:
POEM	29. "Now may every | oath thee bite
POEM	That with Helgi | sworn thou hast,
POEM	By the water | bright of Leipt,
POEM	And the ice-cold | stone of Uth.
POEM	
POEM	30. "The ship shall sail not | in which thou sailest,
POEM	Though a favoring wind | shall follow after;
POEM	The horse shall run not | whereon thou ridest,
POEM	Though fain thou art | thy foe to flee.
POEM	
POEM	31. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	The sword shall bite not | which thou bearest,
POEM	Till thy head itself | it sings about.
POEM	
POEM	32. Vengeance were mine | for Helgi's murder,
POEM	Wert thou a wolf | in the woods without,
POEM	Possessing nought | and knowing no joy,
POEM	Having no food | save corpses to feed on."
POEM	
POEM	Dag spake:
POEM	33. "Mad art thou, sister, | and wild of mind,
POEM	Such a curse | on thy brother to cast;
POEM	Othin is ruler | of every ill,
POEM	Who sunders kin | with runes of spite.
POEM	
POEM	34. "Thy brother rings | so red will give thee,
POEM	All Vandilsve | and Vigdalir;
POEM	Take half my land | to pay the harm,
POEM	Ring-decked maid, | and as meed for thy sons."
POEM	
POEM	Sigrun spake:
POEM	35. "I shall sit not happy | at Sevafjoll,
POEM	Early or late, | my life to love,
POEM	If the light cannot show, | in the leader's band,
POEM	Vigblær bearing him | back to his home,
POEM	(The golden-bitted; | I shall greet him never.)
POEM	
POEM	36. "Such the fear | that Helgi's foes
POEM	Ever felt, | and all their kin,
POEM	As makes the goats | with terror mad
POEM	Run from the wolf | among the rocks.
POEM	
POEM	37. "Helgi rose | above heroes all
POEM	Like the lofty ash | above lowly thorns,
POEM	Or the noble stag, | with dew besprinkled,
POEM	Bearing his head | above all beasts,
POEM	(And his horns gleam bright | to heaven itself.)
POEM	A hill was made in Helgi's memory. And when he
POEM	came to Valhall, then Othin bade him rule over every thing with himself.
POEM	(VII)
POEM	Helgi said:
POEM	A "Thou shalt, Hunding, | of every hero
POEM	Wash the feet, | and kindle the fire,
POEM	Tie up dogs, | and tend the horses,
POEM	And feed the swine | ere to sleep thou goest."
POEM	(VIII)
POEM	One of Sigrun's maidens went one evening to Helgi's hill, and saw that Helgi rode to the hill with many
POEM	men, The maiden said:
POEM	
POEM	39. "Is this a dream | that methinks I see,
POEM	Or the doom of the gods, | that dead men ride,
POEM	And hither spurring | urge your steeds,
POEM	Or is home-coming now | to the heroes granted?"
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	40. "No dream is this | that thou thinkest to see,
POEM	Nor the end of the world, | though us thou beholdest,
POEM	And hither spurring | we urge our steeds,
POEM	Nor is home-coming now | to the heroes granted."
POEM	The maiden went home and said to Sigrun:
POEM	
POEM	41. "Go forth, Sigrun, | from Sevafjoll,
POEM	If fain the lord | of the folk wouldst find;
POEM	(The hill is open, | Helgi is come;)
POEM	The sword-tracks bleed; | the monarch bade
POEM	That thou his wounds | shouldst now make well."
POEM	Sigrun went in the hill to Helgi, and said:
POEM	
POEM	42. "Now am I glad | of our meeting together,
POEM	As Othin's hawks, | so eager for prey,
POEM	When slaughter and flesh | all warm they scent,
POEM	Or dew-wet see | the red of day.
POEM	
POEM	43. "First will I kiss | the lifeless king,
POEM	Ere off the bloody | byrnie thou cast;
POEM	With frost thy hair | is heavy, Helgi,
POEM	And damp thou art | with the dew of death;
POEM	(Ice-cold hands | has Hogni's kinsman,
POEM	What, prince, can I | to bring thee ease?)"
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	44. "Thou alone, Sigrun | of Sevafjoll,
POEM	Art cause that Helgi | with dew is heavy;
POEM	Gold-decked maid, | thy tears are grievous,
POEM	(Sun-bright south-maid, | ere thou sleepest;)
POEM	Each falls like blood | on the hero's breast,
POEM	(Burned-out, cold, | and crushed with care.)
POEM	
POEM	45. "Well shall we drink | a noble draught,
POEM	Though love and lands | are lost to me;
POEM	No man a song | of sorrow shall sing,
POEM	Though bleeding wounds | are on my breast;
POEM	Now in the hill | our brides we hold,
POEM	The heroes' loves, | by their husbands dead."
POEM	Sigrun made ready a bed in the hill.
POEM	
POEM	46. "Here a bed | I have made for thee, Helgi,
POEM	To rest thee from care, | thou kin of the Ylfings;
POEM	I will make thee sink | to sleep in my arms,
POEM	As once I lay | with the living king."
POEM	
POEM	Helgi spake:
POEM	47. "Now do I say | that in Sevafjoll
POEM	Aught may happen, | early or late,
POEM	Since thou sleepest clasped | in a corpse's arms,
POEM	So fair in the hill, | the daughter of Hogni!
POEM	(Living thou comest, | a daughter of kings.)
POEM	
POEM	48. "Now must I ride | the reddened ways,
POEM	And my bay steed set | to tread the sky;
POEM	Westward I go | to wind-helm's bridges,
POEM	Ere Salgofnir wakes | the warrior throng."
POEM	Then Helgi and his followers rode on their way, and
POEM	the women went home to the dwelling. Another evening Sigrun bade the maiden keep watch at the hill.
POEM	And at sunset when Sigrun came to the hill she said:
POEM	
POEM	49. "Now were he come, | if come he might,
POEM	Sigmund's son, | from Othin's seat;
POEM	Hope grows dim | of the hero's return
POEM	When eagles sit | on the ash-tree boughs,
POEM	And men are seeking | the meeting of dreams."
POEM	The Maiden said:
POEM	
POEM	50. "Mad thou wouldst seem | alone to seek,
POEM	Daughter of heroes, | the house of the dead;
POEM	For mightier now | at night are all
POEM	The ghosts of the dead | than when day is bright."
POEM	Sigrun was early dead of sorrow and grief. It was believed in olden times that people were born again,
POEM	but that is now called old wives' folly. Of Helgi and Sigrun it is said that they were born again; he
POEM	became Helgi Haddingjaskati, and she Kara the daughter of Halfdan, as is told in the Lay of Kara, and
POEM	she was a Valkyrie.
TITLE	GRIPISSPO
SUBTITLE	Gripir's Prophecy
POEM	1. "Who is it has | this dwelling here,
POEM	Or what do men call | the people's king?"
POEM	
POEM	Geitir spake:
POEM	Gripir the name | of the chieftain good
POEM	Who holds the folk | and the firm-ruled land.
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	2. "Is the king all-knowing | now within,
POEM	Will the monarch come | with me to speak?
POEM	A man unknown | his counsel needs,
POEM	And Gripir fain | I soon would find."
POEM	
POEM	Geitir spake:
POEM	3. "The ruler glad | of Geitir will ask
POEM	Who seeks with Gripir | speech to have."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	Sigurth am I, | and Sigmund's son,
POEM	And Hjordis the name | of the hero's mother.
POEM	
POEM	4. Then Geitir went | and to Gripir spake:
POEM	A stranger comes | and stands without;
POEM	Lofty he is | to look upon,
POEM	And, prince, thyself | he fain would see.
POEM	
POEM	5. From the hall the ruler | of heroes went,
POEM	And greeted well | the warrior come:
POEM	Sigurth, welcome | long since had been thine;
POEM	Now, Geitir, shalt thou | Grani take.
POEM	
POEM	6. Then of many | things they talked,
POEM	When thus the men | so wise had met.
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	To me, if thou knowest, | my mother's brother,
POEM	Say what life | will Sigurth's be.
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	7. "Of men thou shalt be | on earth the mightiest,
POEM	And higher famed | than all the heroes;
POEM	Free of gold-giving, | slow to flee,
POEM	Noble to see, | and sage in speech."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	8. "Monarch wise, | now more I ask;
POEM	To Sigurth say, | if thou thinkest to see,
POEM	What first will chance | of my fortune fair,
POEM	When hence I go | from out thy home?"
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	9. "First shalt thou, prince, | thy father avenge,
POEM	And Eylimi, | their ills requiting;
POEM	The hardy sons | of Hunding thou
POEM	Soon shalt fell, | and victory find."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	10. "Noble king, | my kinsman, say
POEM	Thy meaning true, | for our minds we speak:
POEM	For Sigurth mighty | deeds dost see,
POEM	The highest beneath | the heavens all?"
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	IT. "The fiery dragon | alone thou shalt fight
POEM	That greedy lies | at Gnitaheith;
POEM	Thou shalt be of Regin | and Fafnir both
POEM	The slayer; truth | doth Gripir tell thee."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	12. "Rich shall I be | if battles I win
POEM	With such as these, | as now thou sayest;
POEM	Forward look, | and further tell:
POEM	What the life | that I shall lead?"
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	13. "Fafnir's den | thou then shalt find,
POEM	And all his treasure | fair shalt take;
POEM	Gold shalt heap | on Grani's back,
POEM	And, proved in fight, | to Gjuki fare."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	14. "To the warrior now | in words. so wise,
POEM	Monarch noble, | more shalt tell;
POEM	I am Gjuki's guest, | and thence I go:
POEM	What the life | that I shall lead?"
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	15. "On the rocks there sleeps | the ruler's daughter,
POEM	Fair in armor, | since Helgi fell;
POEM	Thou shalt cut | with keen-edged sword,
POEM	And cleave the byrnie | with Fafnir's killer."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	16. "The mail-coat is broken, | the maiden speaks,
POEM	The woman who | from sleep has wakened;
POEM	What says the maid | to Sigurth then
POEM	That happy fate | to the hero brings?"
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	17. "Runes to the warrior | will she tell,
POEM	All that men | may ever seek,
POEM	And teach thee to speak | in all men's tongues,
POEM	And life with health; | thou'rt happy, king!"
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	18. "Now is it ended, | the knowledge is won,
POEM	And ready I am | forth thence to ride;
POEM	Forward look | and further tell:
POEM	What the life | that I shall lead?"
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	19. "Then to Heimir's | home thou comest,
POEM	And glad shalt be | the guest of the king;
POEM	Ended, Sigurth, | is all I see,
POEM	No further aught | of Gripir ask."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	20. "Sorrow brings me | the word thou sayest,
POEM	For, monarch, forward | further thou seest;
POEM	Sad the grief | for Sigurth thou knowest,
POEM	Yet nought to me, Gripir, | known wilt make."
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	21. "Before me lay | in clearest light
POEM	All of thy youth | for mine eyes to see;
POEM	Not rightly can I | wise be called,
POEM	Nor forward-seeing; | my wisdom is fled."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	22. "No man, Gripir, | on earth I know
POEM	Who sees the future | as far as thou;
POEM	Hide thou nought, | though hard it be,
POEM	And base the deeds | that I shall do."
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	2Z. "With baseness never | thy life is burdened,
POEM	Hero noble, | hold that sure;
POEM	Lofty as long | as the world shall live,
POEM	Battle-bringer, | thy name shall be."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	24. "Nought could seem worse, | but now must part
POEM	The prince and Sigurth, | since so it is,
POEM	My road I ask,-- | the future lies open,--
POEM	Mighty one, speak, | my mother's brother."
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	25. "Now to Sigurth | all shall I say,
POEM	For to this the warrior | bends my will;
POEM	Thou knowest well | that I will not lie,--
POEM	A day there is | when thy death is doomed."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	26. "No scorn I know | for the noble king,
POEM	But counsel good | from Gripir I seek;
POEM	Well will I know, | though evil awaits,
POEM	What Sigurth may | before him see."
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	27. "A maid in Heimir's | home there dwells,
POEM	Brynhild her name | to men is known,
POEM	Daughter of Buthli, | the doughty king,
POEM	And Heimir fosters | the fearless maid."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	28. "What is it to me, | though the maiden be
POEM	So fair, and of Heimir | the fosterling is?
POEM	Gripir, truth | to me shalt tell,
POEM	For all of fate | before me thou seest."
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	29. "Of many a joy | the maiden robs thee,
POEM	Fair to see, | whom Heimir fosters;
POEM	Sleep thou shalt find not, | feuds thou shalt end not,
POEM	Nor seek out men, | if the maid thou seest not."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	30. "What may be had | for Sigurth's healing?
POEM	Say now, Gripir, | if see thou canst;
POEM	May I buy the maid | with the marriage-price,
POEM	The daughter fair | of the chieftain famed?"
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	31. "Ye twain shall all | the oaths then swear
POEM	That bind full fast; | few shall ye keep;
POEM	One night when Gjuki's | guest thou hast been,
POEM	Will Heimir's fosterling | fade from thy mind."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	32. "What sayst thou, Gripir? | give me the truth,
POEM	Does fickleness hide | in the hero's heart?
POEM	Can it be that troth | I break with the maid,
POEM	With her I believed | I loved so dear?"
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	33. "Tricked by another, | prince, thou art,
POEM	And the price of Grimhild's | wiles thou must pay;
POEM	Fain of thee | for the fair-haired maid,
POEM	Her daughter, she is, | and she drags thee down."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	34. "Might I with Gunnar | kinship make,
POEM	And Guthrun win | to be my wife,
POEM	Well the hero | wedded would be,
POEM	If my treacherous deed | would trouble me not."
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	35. "Wholly Grimhild | thy heart deceives,
POEM	She will bid thee go | and Brynhild woo
POEM	For Gunnar's wife, | the lord of the Goths;
POEM	And the prince's mother | thy promise shall win."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	36. "Evil waits me, | well I see it,
POEM	And gone is Sigurth's | wisdom good,
POEM	If I shall woo | for another to win
POEM	The maiden fair | that so fondly I loved."
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	37. "Ye three shall | all the oaths then take,
POEM	Gunnar and Hogni, | and, hero, thou;
POEM	Your forms ye shall change, | as forth ye tare,
POEM	Gunnar and thou; | for Gripir lies not."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	38. "How meanest thou? | Why make we the change
POEM	Of shape and form | as forth we fare?
POEM	There must follow | another falsehood
POEM	Grim in all ways; | speak on, Gripir!"
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	39. "The form of Gunnar | and shape thou gettest,
POEM	But mind and voice | thine own remain;
POEM	The hand of the fosterling | noble of Heimir
POEM	Now dost thou win, | and none can prevent."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	40. "Most evil it seems, | and men will say
POEM	Base is Sigurth | that so he did;
POEM	Not of my will shall | I cheat with wiles
POEM	The heroes' maiden | whom noblest I hold."
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	41. "Thou dwellest, leader | lofty of men,
POEM	With the maid as if | thy mother she were;
POEM	Lofty as long | as the world shall live,
POEM	Ruler of men, | thy name shall remain."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	42. "Shall Gunnar have | a goodly wife,
POEM	Famed among men,-- | speak forth now, Gripir!
POEM	Although at my side | three nights she slept,
POEM	The warrior's bride? | Such ne'er has been."
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	43. "The marriage draught | will be drunk for both,
POEM	For Sigurth and Gunnar, | in Gjuki's hall;
POEM	Your forms ye change, | when home ye fare,
POEM	But the mind of each | to himself remains."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	44. "Shall the kinship new | thereafter come
POEM	To good among us? | Tell me, Gripir!
POEM	To Gunnar joy | shall it later give,
POEM	Or happiness send | for me myself?"
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	45. "Thine oaths remembering, | silent thou art,
POEM	And dwellest with Guthrun | in wedlock good;
POEM	But Brynhild shall deem | she is badly mated,
POEM	And wiles she seeks, | herself to avenge."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	46. "What may for the bride | requital be,
POEM	The wife we won | with subtle wiles?
POEM	From me she has | the oaths I made,
POEM	And kept not long; | they gladdened her little."
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	47. "To Gunnar soon | his bride will say
POEM	That ill didst thou | thine oath fulfill,
POEM	When the goodly king, | the son of Gjuki,
POEM	With all his heart | the hero trusted."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	48. "What sayst thou, Gripir? | give me the truth!
POEM	Am I guilty so | as now is said,
POEM	Or lies does the far-famed | queen put forth
POEM	Of me and herself? | Yet further speak."
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	49. "In wrath and grief | full little good
POEM	The noble bride | shall work thee now;
POEM	No shame thou gavest | the goodly one,
POEM	Though the monarch's wife | with wiles didst cheat."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	50. "Shall Gunnar the wise | to the woman's words,
POEM	And Gotthorm and Hogni, | then give heed?
POEM	Shall Gjuki's sons, | now tell me, Gripir,
POEM	Redden their blades | with their kinsman's blood?"
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	51. "Heavy it lies | on Guthrun's heart,
POEM	When her brothers all | shall bring thee death;
POEM	Never again | shall she happiness know,
POEM	The woman so fair; | 'tis Grimhild's work."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	52. "Now fare thee well! | our fates we shun not;
POEM	And well has Gripir | answered my wish;
POEM	More of joy | to me wouldst tell
POEM	Of my life to come | if so thou couldst."
POEM	
POEM	Gripir spake:
POEM	53 "Ever remember, ruler of men,

SUBTITLE	The Ballad of Regin
POEM	1. "What is the fish | that runs in the flood,
POEM	And itself from ill cannot save?
POEM	If thy head thou wouldst | from hell redeem,
POEM	Find me the water's flame."
POEM	
POEM	Andvari spake:
POEM	2. "Andvari am I, | and Oin my father,
POEM	In many a fall have I fared;
POEM	An evil Norn | in olden days
POEM	Doomed me In waters to dwell."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	3. "Andvari, say, | if thou seekest still
POEM	To live in the land of men,
POEM	What payment is set | for the sons of men
POEM	Who war with lying words?"
POEM	
POEM	Andvari spake:
POEM	4. "A mighty payment | the men must make
POEM	Who in Valthgelmir's waters wade;
POEM	On a long road lead | the lying words
POEM	That one to another utters."
POEM	Loki saw all the gold that Andvari had. But when
POEM	he had brought forth all the gold, he held back one ring, and Loki took this from him. The dwarf went
POEM	into his rocky hole and said:
POEM	
POEM	5. "Now shall the gold | that Gust once had
POEM	Bring their death | to brothers twain,
POEM	And evil be | for heroes eight;
POEM	joy of my wealth | shall no man win."
POEM	The gods gave Hreithmar the gold, and filled up the otter-skin, and stood it on its feet. Then the gods had
POEM	to heap up gold and hide it. And when that was done, Hreithmar came forward and saw a single whisker,
POEM	and bade them cover it. Then Othin brought out the ring Andvaranaut and covered the hair. Then Loki
POEM	said:
POEM	
POEM	6. "The gold is given, | and great the price
POEM	Thou hast my head to save;
POEM	But fortune thy sons | shall find not there,
POEM	The bane of ye both it is."
POEM	
POEM	Hreithmar spake:
POEM	7. "Gifts ye gave, | but ye gave not kindly,
POEM	Gave not with hearts that were whole;
POEM	Your lives ere this | should ye all have lost,
POEM	If sooner this fate I had seen."
POEM	
POEM	Loki spake:
POEM	8. "Worse is this | that methinks I see,
POEM	For a maid shall kinsmen clash;
POEM	Heroes unborn | thereby shall be,
POEM	I deem, to hatred doomed."
POEM	
POEM	Hreithmar spake:
POEM	9. "The gold so red | shall I rule, methinks,
POEM	So long as I shall live;
POEM	Nought of fear | for thy threats I feel,
POEM	So get ye hence to your homes."
POEM	Fafnir and Regin asked Hreithmar for a share of the wealth that was paid for the slaying of their brother,
POEM	Otr. This he refused, and Fafnir thrust his sword through the
POEM	body of his father, Hreithmar, while he was sleeping. Hreithmar called to his daughters:
POEM	
POEM	10. "Lyngheith and Lofnheith, | fled is my life,
POEM	And mighty now is my need!"
POEM	
POEM	Lyngheith spake:
POEM	Though a sister loses | her father, seldom
POEM	Revenge on her brother she brings.
POEM	
POEM	Hreithmar spake:
POEM	11. "A daughter, woman | with wolf's heart, bear,
POEM	If thou hast no son | with the hero brave;
POEM	If one weds the maid, | for the need is mighty,
POEM	Their son for thy hurt | may vengeance seek."
POEM	Then Hreithmar died, and Fafnir took all the gold. Thereupon Regin asked to have his inheritance from
POEM	his father, but Fafnir refused this. Then Regin asked counsel
POEM	of Lyngheith, his sister, how he should win his inheritance. She said:
POEM	
POEM	12. "In friendly wise | the wealth shalt thou ask
POEM	Of thy brother, and better will;
POEM	Not seemly is it | to seek with the sword
POEM	Fafnir's treasure to take."
POEM	All these happenings did Regin tell to Sigurth.
POEM	One day, when he came to Regin's house, he was gladly welcomed. Regin said:
POEM	
POEM	13. "Hither the son | of Sigmund is come,
POEM	The hero eager, | here to our hall;
POEM	His courage is more | than an ancient man's,
POEM	And battle I hope | from the hardy wolf.
POEM	
POEM	14. "Here shall I foster | the fearless prince,
POEM	Now Yngvi's heir | to us is come;
POEM	The noblest hero | beneath the sun,
POEM	The threads of his fate | all lands enfold."
POEM	Sigurth was there continually with Regin, who said to Sigurth that Fafnir lay at Gnitaheith, and was in
POEM	the shape of a dragon. He had a fear-helm, of which all living creatures were terrified. Regin made
POEM	Sigurth the sword which was called Gram; it was so sharp that when he thrust it down into the Rhine, and
POEM	let a strand of wool drift against it with the stream, it cleft the strand asunder as if it were water. With this
POEM	sword Sigurth cleft asunder Regin's anvil. After that Regin egged Sigurth on to slay Fafnir, but he said:
POEM	
POEM	15. "Loud will the sons | of Hunding laugh,
POEM	Who low did Eylimi | lay in death,
POEM	If the hero sooner | seeks the red
POEM	Rings to find | than his father's vengeance."
POEM	King Hjalprek gave Sigurth a fleet for the avenging
POEM	of his father. They ran into a great storm, and were off a certain headland. A man stood on the mountain,
POEM	and said:
POEM	
POEM	16. "Who yonder rides | on Rævil's steeds,
POEM	O'er towering waves | and waters wild?
POEM	The sail-horses all | with sweat are dripping,
POEM	Nor can the sea-steeds | the gale withstand."
POEM	Regin answered:
POEM	
POEM	17. "On the sea-trees here | are Sigurth and I,
POEM	The storm wind drives us | on to our death;
POEM	The waves crash down | on the forward deck,
POEM	And the roller-steeds sink; | who seeks our names?"
POEM	
POEM	The Man spake:
POEM	18. "Hnikar I was | when Volsung once
POEM	Gladdened the ravens | and battle gave;
POEM	Call me the Man | from the Mountain now,
POEM	Feng or Fjolnir; | with you will I fare."
POEM	
POEM	They sailed to the land, and the man went on board the ship, and the storm subsided. Sigurth spake:
POEM	19. "Hnikar, say, | for thou seest the fate
POEM	That to gods and men is given;
POEM	What sign is fairest | for him who fights,
POEM	And best for the swinging of swords?"
POEM	
POEM	Hnikar spake:
POEM	20. "Many the signs, | if men but knew,
POEM	That are good for the swinging of swords;
POEM	It is well, methinks, | if the warrior meets
POEM	A raven black on his road.
POEM	
POEM	21. "Another it is | if out thou art come,
POEM	And art ready forth to fare,
POEM	To behold on the path | before thy house
POEM	Two fighters greedy of fame.
POEM	
POEM	22. "Third it is well | if a howling wolf
POEM	Thou hearest under the ash;
POEM	And fortune comes | if thy foe thou seest
POEM	Ere thee the hero beholds.
POEM	
POEM	23. "A man shall fight not | when he must face
POEM	The moon's bright sister setting late;
POEM	Win he shall | who well can see,
POEM	And wedge-like forms | his men for the fray.
POEM	
POEM	24. "Foul is the sign | if thy foot shall stumble
POEM	As thou goest forth to fight;
POEM	Goddesses baneful | at both thy sides
POEM	Will that wounds thou shalt get.
POEM	
POEM	25. "Combed and washed | shall the wise man go,
POEM	And a meal at mom shall take;
POEM	For unknown it is | where at eve he may be;
POEM	It is ill thy luck to lose."
POEM	Sigurth had a great battle with Lyngvi, the son of
POEM	Hunding, and his brothers; there Lyngvi fell, and his two brothers with him. After the battle Regin said:
POEM	
POEM	26. "Now the bloody eagle | with biting sword
POEM	Is carved on the back | of Sigmund's killer;
POEM	Few were more fierce | in fight than his son,
POEM	Who reddened the earth | and gladdened the ravens."
POEM	Sigurth went home to Hjalprek's house; thereupon Regin egged him on to fight with Fafnir.
TITLE	FAFNISMOL
SUBTITLE	The Ballad of Fafnir
POEM	1. "Youth, oh, youth! | of whom then, youth, art thou born?
POEM	Say whose son thou art,
POEM	Who in Fafnir's blood | thy bright blade reddened,
POEM	And struck thy sword to my heart."
POEM	Sigurth concealed his name because it was believed in olden times that the word of a dying man might
POEM	have great power if he cursed his foe by his name. He said:
POEM	
POEM	2. "The Noble Hart | my name, and I go
POEM	A motherless man abroad;
POEM	Father I had not, | as others have,
POEM	And lonely ever I live."
POEM	
POEM	Fafnir spake:
POEM	3. "If father thou hadst not, | as others have,
POEM	By what wonder wast thou born?
POEM	(Though thy name on the day | of my death thou hidest,
POEM	Thou knowest now thou dost lie.)"
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	4. "My race, methinks, | is unknown to thee,
POEM	And so am I myself;
POEM	Sigurth my name, | and Sigmund's son,
POEM	Who smote thee thus with the sword."
POEM	
POEM	Fafnir spake:
POEM	5. "Who drove thee on? | why wert thou driven
POEM	My life to make me lose?
POEM	A father brave | had the bright-eyed youth,
POEM	For bold in boyhood thou art."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	6. "My heart did drive me, | my hand fulfilled,
POEM	And my shining sword so sharp;
POEM	Few are keen | when old age comes,
POEM	Who timid in boyhood be."
POEM	
POEM	Fafnir spake:
POEM	7. "If thou mightest grow | thy friends among,
POEM	One might see thee fiercely fight;
POEM	But bound thou art, | and in battle taken,
POEM	And to fear are prisoners prone."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	8. "Thou blamest me, Fafnir, | that I see from afar
POEM	The wealth that my father's was;
POEM	Not bound am I, | though in battle taken,
POEM	Thou hast found that free I live."
POEM	
POEM	Fafnir spake:
POEM	9. "In all I say | dost thou hatred see,
POEM	Yet truth alone do I tell;
POEM	The sounding gold, | the glow-red wealth,
POEM	And the rings thy bane shall be."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	10. "Some one the hoard | shall ever hold,
POEM	Till the destined day shall come;
POEM	For a time there is | when every man
POEM	Shall journey hence to hell."
POEM	
POEM	Fafnir spake:
POEM	11. "The fate of the Norns | before the headland
POEM	Thou findest, and doom of a fool;
POEM	In the water shalt drown | if thou row 'gainst the wind,
POEM	All danger is near to death."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	12. "Tell me then, Fafnir, | for wise thou art famed,
POEM	And much thou knowest now:
POEM	Who are the Norns | who are helpful in need,
POEM	And the babe from the mother bring?"
POEM	
POEM	Fafnir spake:
POEM	13. "Of many births | the Norns must be,
POEM	Nor one in race they were;
POEM	Some to gods, others | to elves are kin,
POEM	And Dvalin's daughters some."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	14. "Tell me then, Fafnir, | for wise thou art famed,
POEM	And much thou knowest now:
POEM	How call they the isle | where all the gods
POEM	And Surt shall sword-sweat mingle?"
POEM	
POEM	Fafnir spake:
POEM	15. "Oskopnir is it, | where all the gods
POEM	Shall seek the play of swords;
POEM	Bilrost breaks | when they cross the bridge,
POEM	And the steeds shall swim in the flood.
POEM	
POEM	16. "The fear-helm I wore | to afright mankind,
POEM	While guarding my gold I lay;
POEM	Mightier seemed I | than any man,
POEM	For a fiercer never I found."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	17. "The fear-helm surely | no man shields
POEM	When he faces a valiant foe;
POEM	Oft one finds, | when the foe he meets,
POEM	That he is not the bravest of all."
POEM	
POEM	Fafnir spake:
POEM	18. "Venom I breathed | when bright I lay
POEM	By the hoard my father had;
POEM	(There was none so mighty | as dared to meet me,
POEM	And weapons nor wiles I feared.)"
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	19. "Glittering worm, | thy hissing was great,
POEM	And hard didst show thy heart;
POEM	But hatred more | have the sons of men
POEM	For him who owns the helm."
POEM	
POEM	Fafnir spake:
POEM	20. "I counsel thee, Sigurth, | heed my speech,
POEM	And ride thou homeward hence,
POEM	The sounding gold, | the glow-red wealth,
POEM	And the rings thy bane shall be."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	21. "Thy counsel is given, | but go I shall
POEM	To the gold in the heather hidden;
POEM	And, Fafnir, thou | with death dost fight,
POEM	Lying where Hel shall have thee."
POEM	
POEM	Fafnir spake:
POEM	22. "Regin betrayed me, | and thee will betray,
POEM	Us both to death will he bring;
POEM	His life, methinks, | must Fafnir lose,
POEM	For the mightier man wast thou."
POEM	Regin had gone to a distance while Sigurth fought Fafnir, and came back while Sigurth was wiping the
POEM	blood from his sword. Regin said:
POEM	
POEM	23. "Hail to thee, Sigurth! | Thou victory hast,
POEM	And Fafnir in fight hast slain;
POEM	Of all the men | who tread the earth,
POEM	Most fearless art thou, methinks."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	24. "Unknown it is, | when all are together,
POEM	(The sons of the glorious gods,)
POEM	Who bravest born shall seem;
POEM	Some are valiant | who redden no sword
POEM	In the blood of a foeman's breast."
POEM	
POEM	Regin spake:
POEM	25. "Glad art thou, Sigurth, | of battle gained,
POEM	As Gram with grass thou cleansest;
POEM	My brother fierce | in fight hast slain,
POEM	And somewhat I did myself."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	26. "Afar didst thou go | while Fafnir reddened
POEM	With his blood my blade so keen;
POEM	With the might of the dragon | my strength I matched,
POEM	While thou in the heather didst hide."
POEM	
POEM	Regin spake:
POEM	27. "Longer wouldst thou | in the heather have let
POEM	Yon hoary giant hide,
POEM	Had the weapon availed not | that once I forged,
POEM	The keen-edged blade thou didst bear."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	28. "Better is heart | than a mighty blade
POEM	For him who shall fiercely fight;
POEM	The brave man well | shall fight and win,
POEM	Though dull his blade may be.
POEM	
POEM	29. "Brave men better | than cowards be,
POEM	When the clash of battle comes;
POEM	And better the glad | than the gloomy man
POEM	Shall face what before him lies.
POEM	
POEM	30. "Thy rede it was | that I should ride
POEM	Hither o'er mountains high;
POEM	The glittering worm | would have wealth and life
POEM	If thou hadst not mocked at my might."
POEM	Then Regin went up to Fafnir and cut out his heart with his sword, that was named Rithil, and then he
POEM	drank blood from the wounds. Regin said:
POEM	
POEM	31. "Sit now, Sigurth, | for sleep will I,
POEM	Hold Fafnir's heart to the fire;
POEM	For all his heart | shall eaten be,
POEM	Since deep of blood I have drunk."
POEM	Sigurth took Fafnir's heart and cooked it on a spit. When he thought that it was fully cooked, and the
POEM	blood foamed out of the heart, then he tried it with his finger to see whether it was fully cooked. He
POEM	burned his finger, and put it in his mouth. But when Fafnir's heart's-blood came on his tongue, he
POEM	understood the speech of birds. He heard nut-hatches chattering in the thickets. A nut hatch said:
POEM	
POEM	32. "There sits Sigurth, | sprinkled with blood,
POEM	And Fafnir's heart | with fire he cooks;
POEM	Wise were the breaker | of rings, I ween,
POEM	To eat the life-muscles | all so bright."
POEM	
POEM	A second spake:
POEM	33. "There Regin lies, | and plans he lays
POEM	The youth to betray | who trusts him well;
POEM	Lying words | with wiles will he speak,
POEM	Till his brother the maker | of mischief avenges."
POEM	
POEM	A third spake:
POEM	34. "Less by a head | let the chatterer hoary
POEM	Go from here to hell;
POEM	Then all of the wealth | he alone can wield,
POEM	The gold that Fafnir guarded."
POEM	
POEM	A fourth spake:
POEM	35. "Wise would he seem | if so he would heed
POEM	The counsel good | we sisters give;
POEM	Thought he would give, | and the ravens gladden,
POEM	There is ever a wolf | where his ears I spy."
POEM	
POEM	A fifth spake:
POEM	36. "Less wise must be | the tree of battle
POEM	Than to me would seem | the leader of men,
POEM	If forth he lets | one brother fare,
POEM	When he of the other | the slayer is."
POEM	
POEM	A sixth spake:
POEM	37. "Most foolish he seems | if he shall spare
POEM	His foe, the bane of the folk,
POEM	There Regin lies, | who hath wronged him so,
POEM	Yet falsehood knows he not."
POEM	
POEM	A seventh spake:
POEM	38. "Let the head from the frost-cold | giant be hewed,
POEM	And let him of rings be robbed;
POEM	Then all the wealth | which Fafnir's was
POEM	Shall belong to thee alone."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	39. "Not so rich a fate | shall Regin have
POEM	As the tale of my death to tell;
POEM	For soon the brothers | both shall die,
POEM	And hence to hell shall go."
POEM	Sigurth hewed off Regin's head, and then he ate Fafnir's heart, and drank the blood of both Regin and
POEM	Fafnir. Then Sigurth heard what the nut-hatch said:
POEM	
POEM	40. "Bind, Sigurth, the golden | rings together,
POEM	Not kingly is it | aught to fear;
POEM	I know a maid, | there is none so fair,
POEM	Rich in gold, | if thou mightest get her.
POEM	
POEM	41. "Green the paths | that to Gjuki lead,
POEM	And his fate the way | to the wanderer shows;
POEM	The doughty king | a daughter has,
POEM	That thou as a bride | mayst, Sigurth, buy."
POEM	
POEM	Another spake:
POEM	42. "A hall stands high | on Hindarfjoll,
POEM	All with flame | is it ringed without;
POEM	Warriors wise | did make it once
POEM	Out of the flaming | light of the flood.
POEM	
POEM	43. "On the mountain sleeps | a battle-maid,
POEM	And about her plays | the bane of the wood;
POEM	Ygg with the thorn | hath smitten her thus,
POEM	For she felled the fighter | he fain would save.
POEM	
POEM	44. "There mayst thou behold | the maiden helmed,
POEM	Who forth on Vingskornir | rode from the fight;
POEM	The victory-bringer | her sleep shall break not,
POEM	Thou heroes' son, | so the Norns have set."
POEM	Sigurth rode along Fafnir's trail to his lair, and found it open. The gate-posts were of iron, and the gates;
POEM	of iron, too, were all the beams in the house, which was dug down into the earth. There Sigurth found a
POEM	mighty store of gold, and he filled two chests full thereof; he took the fear-helm and a golden mail-coat
POEM	and the sword Hrotti, and many other precious things, and loaded Grani with them, but the horse would
POEM	not go forward until Sigurth mounted on his back.

POEM	He answered:
POEM	Sigmund's son, | with Sigurth's sword,
POEM	That late with flesh | hath fed the ravens.
POEM	Sigurth sat beside her and asked her name. She took a horn full of mead and gave him a

POEM

POEM	4. "Long did I sleep, | my slumber was long,
POEM	And long are the griefs of life;

POEM	Her name was Sigrdrifa, and she was a Valkyrie. She said that two kings fought in battle; one was called
POEM	Hjalmgunnar, an old man but a mighty warrior, and Othin had promised him the victory, and
POEM	The other was Agnar, | brother of Autha,
POEM	None he found | who fain would shield him.
POEM	Sigrdrifa, slew Hjalmgunnar in the battle, and Othin pricked her with the sleep-thorn in punishment for
POEM	this, and said that she should never thereafter win victory in battle, but that she should be wedded. "And I
POEM	said to him that I had made a vow in my turn, that I would
POEM	never marry a man who knew the meaning of fear." Sigurth answered and asked her to teach him
POEM	wisdom, if she knew of what took place in all the worlds. Sigrdrifa said:

POEM	* * * * * *
POEM	
POEM	18. Shaved off were the runes | that of old were written,
POEM	And mixed with the holy mead,
POEM	And sent on ways so wide;
POEM	So the gods had them, | so the elves got them,
POEM	And some for the Wanes so wise,
POEM	And some for mortal men.
POEM	
POEM	19. Beech-runes are there, | birth-runes are there,
POEM	And all the runes of ale,
POEM	And the magic runes of might;
POEM	Who knows them rightly | and reads them true,
POEM	Has them himself to help;
POEM	Ever they aid,
POEM	Till the gods are gone.
POEM	* * * * * *
POEM	
POEM	Brynhild spake:
POEM	20. "Now shalt thou choose, | for the choice is given,
POEM	Thou tree of the biting blade;
POEM	Speech or silence, | 'tis thine to say,
POEM	Our evil is destined all."
POEM	
POEM	Sigurth spake:
POEM	21. "I shall not flee, | though my fate be near,
POEM	I was born not a coward to be;
POEM	Thy loving word | for mine will I win,
POEM	As long as I shall live."
POEM	
POEM	22. Then first I rede thee, | that free of guilt
POEM	Toward kinsmen ever thou art;
POEM	No vengeance have, | though they work thee harm,
POEM	Reward after death thou shalt win.
POEM	
POEM	23. Then second I rede thee, | to swear no oath
POEM	If true thou knowest it not;
POEM	Bitter the fate | of the breaker of troth,
POEM	And poor is the wolf of his word.
POEM	
POEM	24. Then third I rede thee, | that thou at the Thing
POEM	Shalt fight not in words with fools;
POEM	For the man unwise | a worser word
POEM	Than he thinks doth utter oft.
POEM	
POEM	25. Ill it is | if silent thou art,
POEM	A coward born men call thee,
POEM	And truth mayhap they tell;
POEM	Seldom safe is fame,
POEM	Unless wide renown be won;
POEM	On the day thereafter | send him to death,
POEM	Let him pay the price of his lies.
POEM	
POEM	26. Then fourth I rede thee, | if thou shalt find
POEM	A wily witch on thy road,
POEM	It is better to go | than her guest to be,
POEM	Though night enfold thee fast.
POEM	
POEM	27. Eyes that see | need the sons of men
POEM	Who fight in battle fierce;
POEM	Oft witches evil | sit by the way,
POEM	Who blade and courage blunt.
POEM	
POEM	28. Then fifth I rede thee, | though maidens fair
POEM	Thou seest on benches sitting,
POEM	Let the silver of kinship | not rob thee of sleep,
POEM	And the kissing of women beware.
POEM	
POEM	29. Then sixth I rede thee, | if men shall wrangle,
POEM	And ale-talk rise to wrath,
POEM	No words with a drunken | warrior have,
POEM	For wine steals many men's wits.
POEM	
POEM	30. Brawls and ale | full oft have been
POEM	An ill to many a man,
POEM	Death for some, | and sorrow for some;
POEM	Full many the woes of men.
POEM	
POEM	31. Then seventh I rede thee, | if battle thou seekest
POEM	With a foe that is full of might;
POEM	It is better to fight | than to burn alive
POEM	In the hall of the hero rich.
POEM	
POEM	32. Then eighth I rede thee, | that evil thou shun,
POEM	And beware of lying words;
POEM	Take not a maid, | nor the wife of a man,
POEM	Nor lure them on to lust.
POEM	
POEM	33. Then ninth I rede thee: | burial render
POEM	If thou findest a fallen corpse,
POEM	Of sickness dead, | or dead in the sea,
POEM	Or dead of weapons' wounds.
POEM	
POEM	34. A bath shalt thou give them | who corpses be,
POEM	And hands and head shalt wash;
POEM	Wipe them and comb, | ere they go in the coffin,
POEM	And pray that they sleep in peace.
POEM	
POEM	35. Then tenth I rede thee, | that never thou trust
POEM	The word of the race of wolves,
POEM	(If his brother thou broughtest to death,
POEM	Or his father thou didst fell;)
POEM	Often a wolf | in a son there is,
POEM	Though gold he gladly takes.
POEM	
POEM	36. Battle and hate | and harm, methinks,
POEM	Full seldom fall asleep;
POEM	Wits and weapons | the warrior needs
POEM	If boldest of men he would be.
POEM	
POEM	37. Then eleventh I rede thee, | that wrath thou shun,
POEM	And treachery false with thy friends;
POEM	Not long the leader's | life shall be,
POEM	For great are the foes he faces.
TITLE	BROT AF SIGURTHARKVITHU
SUBTITLE	Fragment of a Sigurth Lay
POEM	1. "(What evil deed | has Sigurth) done,
POEM	That the hero's life | thou fain wouldst have?"
POEM	
POEM	Gunnar spake:
POEM	2. "Sigurth oaths | to me hath sworn,
POEM	Oaths hath sworn, | and all hath broken;
POEM	He betrayed me there | where truest all
POEM	His oaths, methinks, | he ought to have kept."
POEM	
POEM	Hogni spake:
POEM	3. "Thy heart hath Brynhild | whetted to hate,
POEM	Evil to work | and harm to win,
POEM	She grudges the honor | that Guthrun has,
POEM	And that joy of herself | thou still dost have."
POEM	
POEM	4. They cooked a wolf, | they cut up a snake,
POEM	They gave to Gotthorm | the greedy one's flesh,
POEM	Before the men, | to murder minded,
POEM	Laid their hands | on the hero bold.
POEM	
POEM	5. Slain was Sigurth | south of the Rhine;
POEM	From a limb a raven | called full loud:
POEM	Your blood shall redden | Atli's blade,
POEM	And your oaths shall bind | you both in chains.
POEM	
POEM	6. Without stood Guthrun, | Gjuki's daughter,
POEM	
POEM	Hear now the speech | that first she spake:
POEM	Where is Sigurth now, | the noble king,
POEM	That my kinsmen riding | before him come?
POEM	
POEM	7. Only this | did Hogni answer:
POEM	Sigurth we | with our swords have slain;
POEM	The gray horse mourns | by his master dead.
POEM	
POEM	8. Then Brynhild spake, | the daughter of Buthli:
POEM	Well shall ye joy | in weapons and lands;
POEM	Sigurth alone | of all had been lord,
POEM	If a little longer | his life had been.
POEM	
POEM	9. Right were it not | that so he should rule
POEM	O'er Gjuki's wealth | and the race of the Goths;
POEM	Five are the sons | for ruling the folk,
POEM	And greedy of fight, | that he hath fathered."
POEM	
POEM	10. Then Brynhild laughed-- | and the building echoed--
POEM	Only once, | with all her heart;
POEM	Long shall ye joy | in lands and men,
POEM	Now ye have slain | the hero noble.
POEM	
POEM	11. Then Guthrun spake, | the daughter of Gjuki:
POEM	Much thou speakest | in evil speech;
POEM	Accursed be Gunnar, | Sigurth's killer,
POEM	Vengeance shall come | for his cruel heart.
POEM	
POEM	12. Early came evening, | and ale was drunk,
POEM	And among them long | and loud they talked.;
POEM	They slumbered all | when their beds they sought,
POEM	But Gunnar alone | was long awake.
POEM	
POEM	13. His feet were tossing, | he talked to himself,
POEM	And the slayer of hosts | began to heed
POEM	What the twain from the tree | had told him then,
POEM	The raven and eagle, | as home they rode.
POEM	
POEM	14. Brynhild awoke, | the daughter of Buthli,
POEM	The warrior's daughter, | ere dawn of day:
POEM	Love me or hate me, | the harm is done,
POEM	And my grief cries out, | or else I die.
POEM	
POEM	15. Silent were all | who heard her speak,
POEM	And nought of the heart | of the queen they knew,
POEM	Who wept such tears | the thing to tell
POEM	That laughing once | of the men she had won.
POEM	
POEM	Brynhild spake:
POEM	16. "Gunnar, I dreamed | a dream full grim:
POEM	In the hall were corpses; | cold was my bed;
POEM	And, ruler, thou | didst joyless ride,
POEM	With fetters bound | in the foemen's throng.
POEM	
POEM	17. ". . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Utterly now your | Niflung race
POEM	All shall die; | your oaths ye have broken.
POEM	
POEM	18. "Thou hast, Gunnar, | the deed forgot,
POEM	When blood in your footprints | both ye mingled;
POEM	All to him | hast repaid with ill
POEM	Who fain had made thee | the foremost of kings.
POEM	
POEM	19. "Well did he prove, | when proud he rode
POEM	To win me then | thy wife to be,
POEM	How true the host-slayer | ever had held
POEM	The oaths he had made | with the monarch young.
POEM	
POEM	20. "The wound-staff then, | all wound with gold,
POEM	The hero let | between us lie;
POEM	With fire the edge | was forged full keen,
POEM	And with drops of venom | the blade was damp."
POEM	Here it is told in this poem about the death of Sigurth, and the story goes here that they slew him out of
POEM	doors, but some say that they slew him in the house, on his bed
POEM	while he was sleeping. But German men say that they killed him out of doors in the forest; and so it is
POEM	told in the old Guthrun lay, that Sigurth and Gjuki's sons had ridden to the council-place, and that he was
POEM	slain there. But in this they are all agreed, that they deceived him in his trust of them, and fell upon him
POEM	when he was lying down and unprepared.
TITLE	GUTHRUNARKVITHA I
SUBTITLE	The First Lay of Guthrun
POEM	1. Then did Guthrun | think to die,
POEM	When she by Sigurth | sorrowing sat;
POEM	Tears she had not, | nor wrung her hands,
POEM	Nor ever wailed, | as other women.
POEM	
POEM	2. To her the warriors | wise there came,
POEM	Longing her heavy | woe to lighten;
POEM	Grieving could not | Guthrun weep,
POEM	So sad her heart, | it seemed, would break.
POEM	
POEM	3. Then the wives | of the warriors came,
POEM	Gold-adorned, | and Guthrun sought;
POEM	Each one then | of her own grief spoke,
POEM	The bitterest pain | she had ever borne.
POEM	
POEM	4. Then spake Gjaflaug, | Gjuki's sister:
POEM	Most joyless of all | on earth am I;
POEM	Husbands five | were from me taken,
POEM	(Two daughters then, | and sisters three,)
POEM	Brothers eight, | yet I have lived.
POEM	
POEM	5. Grieving could not | Guthrun weep,
POEM	Such grief she had | for her husband dead,
POEM	And so grim her heart | by the hero's body.
POEM	
POEM	6. Then Herborg spake, | the queen of the Huns:
POEM	I have a greater | grief to tell;
POEM	My seven sons | in the southern land,
POEM	And my husband, fell | in fight all eight.
POEM	(Father and mother | and brothers four
POEM	Amid the waves | the wind once smote,
POEM	And the seas crashed through | the sides of the ship.)
POEM	
POEM	7. The bodies all | with my own hands then
POEM	I decked for the grave, | and the dead I buried;
POEM	A half-year brought me | this to bear;
POEM	And no one came | to comfort me.
POEM	
POEM	8. "Then bound I was, | and taken in war,
POEM	A sorrow yet | in the same half-year;
POEM	They bade me deck | and bind the shoes
POEM	Of the wife of the monarch | every morn.
POEM	
POEM	9. "In jealous rage | her wrath she spake,
POEM	And beat me oft | with heavy blows;
POEM	Never a better | lord I knew,
POEM	And never a woman | worse I found."
POEM	
POEM	10. Grieving could not | Guthrun weep,
POEM	Such grief she had | for her husband dead,
POEM	And so grim her heart | by the hero's body.
POEM	
POEM	11. Then spake Gollrond, | Gjuki's daughter:
POEM	Thy wisdom finds not, | my foster-mother,
POEM	The way to comfort | the wife so young.
POEM	She bade them uncover | the warrior's corpse.
POEM	
POEM	12. The shroud she lifted | from Sigurth, laying
POEM	His well-loved head | on the knees of his wife:
POEM	Look on thy loved one, | and lay thy lips
POEM	To his as if yet | the hero lived.
POEM	
POEM	13. Once alone did | Guthrun look;
POEM	His hair all clotted | with blood beheld,
POEM	The blinded eyes | that once shone bright,
POEM	The hero's breast | that the blade had pierced.
POEM	
POEM	14. Then Guthrun bent, | on her pillow bowed,
POEM	Her hair was loosened, | her cheek was hot,
POEM	And the tears like raindrops | downward ran.
POEM	
POEM	15. Then Guthrun, daughter | of Gjuki, wept,
POEM	And through her tresses | flowed the tears;
POEM	And from the court | came the cry of geese,
POEM	The birds so fair | of the hero's bride.
POEM	
POEM	16. Then Gollrond spake, | the daughter of Gjuki:
POEM	Never a greater | love I knew
POEM	Than yours among | all men on earth;
POEM	Nowhere wast happy, | at home or abroad,
POEM	Sister mine, | with Sigurth away.
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	17. "So was my Sigurth | o'er Gjuki's sons
POEM	As the spear-leek grown | above the grass,
POEM	Or the jewel bright | borne on the band,
POEM	The precious stone | that princes wear.
POEM	
POEM	18. "To the leader of men | I loftier seemed
POEM	And higher than all | of Herjan's maids;
POEM	As little now | as the leaf I am
POEM	On the willow hanging; | my hero is dead.
POEM	
POEM	19. "In his seat, in his bed, | I see no more
POEM	My heart's true friend; | the fault is theirs,
POEM	The sons of Gjuki, | for all my grief,
POEM	That so their sister | sorely weeps.
POEM	
POEM	20. "So shall your land | its people lose
POEM	As ye have kept | your oaths of yore;
POEM	Gunnar, no joy | the gold shall give thee,
POEM	(The rings shall soon | thy slayers be,)
POEM	Who swarest oaths | with Sigurth once.
POEM	
POEM	21. "In the court was greater | gladness then
POEM	The day my Sigurth | Grani saddled,
POEM	And went forth Brynhild's | hand to win,
POEM	That woman ill, | in an evil hour."
POEM	
POEM	22. Then Brynhild spake, | the daughter of Buthli:
POEM	May the witch now husband | and children want
POEM	Who, Guthrun, loosed | thy tears at last,
POEM	And with magic today | hath made thee speak.
POEM	
POEM	23. Then Gollrond, daughter | of Gjuki, spake:
POEM	Speak not such words, | thou hated woman;
POEM	Bane of the noble | thou e'er hast been,
POEM	(Borne thou art | on an evil wave,
POEM	Sorrow hast brought | to seven kings,)
POEM	And many a woman | hast loveless made.
POEM	
POEM	24. Then Brynhild, daughter | of Buthli, spake:
POEM	Atli is guilty | of all the sorrow,
POEM	(Son of Buthli | and brother of mine,)
POEM	When we saw in the hall | of the Hunnish race
POEM	The flame of the snake's bed | flash round the hero;
POEM	(For the journey since | full sore have I paid,
POEM	And ever I seek | the sight to forget.)
POEM	
POEM	25. By the pillars she stood, | and gathered her strength,
POEM	From the eyes of Brynhild, | Buthli's daughter,
POEM	Fire there burned, | and venom she breathed,
POEM	When the wounds she saw | on Sigurth then.
POEM	Guthrun went thence away to a forest in the waste, and journeyed all the way to Denmark, and was there
POEM	seven half-years with Thora, daughter of Hokon. Brynhild would not live after Sigurth. She had eight of
POEM	her thralls slain and five serving-women. Then she killed her self with a sword, as is told in the Short Lay
POEM	of Sigurth.
TITLE	SIGURTHARKVITHA EN SKAMMA
SUBTITLE	The Short Lay of Sigurth
POEM	1. Of old did Sigurth | Gjuki seek,
POEM	The Volsung young, | in battles victor;
POEM	Well he trusted | the brothers twain,
POEM	With mighty oaths | among them sworn.
POEM	
POEM	2. A maid they gave him, | and jewels many,
POEM	Guthrun the young, | the daughter of Gjuki;
POEM	They drank and spake | full many a day,
POEM	Sigurth the young | and Gjuki's sons.
POEM	
POEM	3. Thereafter went they | Brynhild to woo,
POEM	And so with them | did Sigurth ride,
POEM	The Volsung young, | in battle valiant,--
POEM	Himself would have had her | if all he had seen.
POEM	
POEM	4. The southern hero | his naked sword,
POEM	Fair-flashing, let | between them lie;
POEM	(Nor would he come | the maid to kiss;)
POEM	The Hunnish king | in his arms ne'er held
POEM	The maiden he gave | to Gjuki's sons.
POEM	
POEM	5. Ill she had known not | in all her life,
POEM	And nought of the sorrows | of men she knew;
POEM	Blame she had not, | nor dreamed she should bear it,
POEM	But cruel the fates | that among them came.
POEM	
POEM	6. By herself at the end | of day she sat,
POEM	And in open words | her heart she uttered:
POEM	I shall Sigurth have, | the hero young,
POEM	E'en though within | my arms he die.
POEM	
POEM	7. The word I have spoken; | soon shall I rue it,
POEM	His wife is Guthrun, | and Gunnar's am I;
POEM	Ill Norns set for me | long desire."
POEM	
POEM	8. Oft did she go | with grieving heart
POEM	On the glacier's ice | at even-tide,
POEM	When Guthrun then | to her bed was gone,
POEM	And the bedclothes Sigurth | about her laid.
POEM	
POEM	9. " (Now Gjuki's child | to her lover goes,)
POEM	And the Hunnish king | with his wife is happy;
POEM	Joyless I am | and mateless ever,
POEM	Till cries from my heavy | heart burst forth."
POEM	
POEM	10. In her wrath to battle | she roused herself:
POEM	Gunnar, now | thou needs must lose
POEM	Lands of mine | and me myself,
POEM	No joy shall I have | with the hero ever.
POEM	
POEM	11. Back shall I fare | where first I dwelt,
POEM	Among the kin | that come of my race,
POEM	To wait there, sleeping | my life away,
POEM	If Sigurth's death | thou shalt not dare,
POEM	(And best of heroes | thou shalt not be.)
POEM	
POEM	12. "The son shall fare | with his father hence,
POEM	And let not long | the wolf-cub live;
POEM	Lighter to pay | is the vengeance-price
POEM	After the deed | if the son is dead."
POEM	
POEM	13. Sad was Gunnar, | and bowed with grief,
POEM	Deep in thought | the whole day through;
POEM	Yet from his heart | it was ever hid
POEM	What deed most fitting | he should find,
POEM	(Or what thing best | for him should be,
POEM	Or if he should seek | the Volsung to slay,
POEM	For with mighty longing | Sigurth he loved.)
POEM	
POEM	14. Much he pondered | for many an hour;
POEM	Never before | was the wonder known
POEM	That a queen should thus | her kingdom leave;
POEM	In counsel then | did he Hogni call,
POEM	(For him in truest | trust he held.)
POEM	
POEM	15. "More than all | to me is Brynhild,
POEM	Buthli's child, | the best of women;
POEM	My very life | would I sooner lose
POEM	Than yield the love | of yonder maid.
POEM	
POEM	16. "Wilt thou the hero | for wealth betray?
POEM	Twere good to have | the gold of the Rhine,
POEM	And all the hoard | in peace to hold,
POEM	And waiting fortune | thus to win."
POEM	
POEM	17. Few the words | of Hogni were:
POEM	Us it beseems not | so to do,
POEM	To cleave with swords | the oaths we swore,
POEM	The oaths we swore | and all our vows.
POEM	
POEM	18. We know no mightier | men on earth
POEM	The while we four | o'er the folk hold sway,
POEM	And while the Hunnish | hero lives,
POEM	Nor higher kinship | the world doth hold.
POEM	
POEM	19. "If sons we five | shall soon beget,
POEM	Great, methinks, | our race shall grow;
POEM	Well I see | whence lead the ways;
POEM	Too bitter far | is Brynhild's hate."
POEM	
POEM	Gunnar spake:
POEM	20. "Gotthorm to wrath | we needs must rouse,
POEM	Our younger brother, | in rashness blind;
POEM	He entered not | in the oaths we swore,
POEM	The oaths we swore | and all our vows."
POEM	
POEM	21. It was easy to rouse | the reckless one.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	The sword in the heart | of Sigurth stood.
POEM	
POEM	22. In vengeance the hero | rose in the hall,
POEM	And hurled his sword | at the slayer bold;
POEM	At Gotthorm flew | the glittering steel
POEM	Of Gram full hard | from the hand of the king.
POEM	
POEM	23. The foeman cleft | asunder fell,
POEM	Forward hands | and head did sink,
POEM	And legs and feet | did backward fall.
POEM	
POEM	24. Guthrun soft | in her bed had slept,
POEM	Safe from care | at Sigurth's side;
POEM	She woke to find | her joy had fled,
POEM	In the blood of the friend | of Freyr she lay.
POEM	
POEM	25. So hard she smote | her hands together
POEM	That the hero rose up, | iron-hearted:
POEM	Weep not, Guthrun, | grievous tears,
POEM	Bride so young, | for thy brothers live.
POEM	
POEM	26. Too young, methinks, | is my son as yet,
POEM	He cannot flee | from the home of his foes;
POEM	Fearful and deadly | the plan they found,
POEM	The counsel new | that now they have heeded.
POEM	
POEM	27. "No son will ride, | though seven thou hast,
POEM	To the Thing as the son | of their sister rides;
POEM	Well I see | who the ill has worked,
POEM	On Brynhild alone | lies the blame for all.
POEM	
POEM	28. "Above all men | the maiden loved me,
POEM	Yet false to Gunnar | I ne'er was found;
POEM	I kept the oaths | and the kinship I swore;
POEM	Of his queen the lover | none may call me.
POEM	
POEM	29. In a swoon she sank | when Sigurth died;
POEM	So hard she smote | her hands together
POEM	That all the cups | in the cupboard rang,
POEM	And loud in the courtyard | cried the geese.
POEM	
POEM	30. Then Brynhild, daughter | of Buthli, laughed,
POEM	Only once, | with all her heart,
POEM	When as she lay | full loud she heard
POEM	The grievous wail | of Gjuki's daughter.
POEM	
POEM	31. Then Gunnar, monarch | of men, spake forth:
POEM	Thou dost not laugh, | thou lover of hate,
POEM	In gladness there, | or for aught of good;
POEM	Why has thy face | so white a hue,
POEM	Mother of ill? | Foredoomed thou art.
POEM	
POEM	32. A worthier woman | wouldst thou have been
POEM	If before thine eyes | we had Atli slain;
POEM	If thy brother's bleeding | body hadst seen
POEM	And the bloody wounds | that thou shouldst End."
POEM	
POEM	Brynhild spake:
POEM	33. "None mock thee, Gunnar! | thou hast mightily fought,
POEM	But thy hatred little | doth Atli heed;
POEM	Longer than thou, | methinks, shall he live,
POEM	And greater in might | shall he ever remain.
POEM	
POEM	34. "To thee I say, | and thyself thou knowest,
POEM	That all these ills | thou didst early shape;
POEM	No bonds I knew, | nor sorrow bore,
POEM	And wealth I had | in my brother's home.
POEM	
POEM	35. "Never a husband | sought I to have,
POEM	Before the Gjukungs | fared to our land;
POEM	Three were the kings | on steeds that came,--
POEM	Need of their journey | never there was.
POEM	
POEM	36. "To the hero great | my troth I gave
POEM	Who gold-decked sat | on Grani's back;
POEM	Not like to thine | was the light of his eyes,
POEM	(Nor like in form | and face are ye,)
POEM	Though kingly both | ye seemed to be.
POEM	
POEM	37. "And so to me | did Atli say
POEM	That share in our wealth | I should not have,
POEM	Of gold or lands, | if my hand I gave not;
POEM	(More evil yet, | the wealth I should yield,)
POEM	The gold that he | in my childhood gave me,
POEM	(The wealth from him | in my youth I had.)
POEM	
POEM	38. "Oft in my mind | I pondered much
POEM	If still I should fight, | and warriors fell,
POEM	Brave in my byrnie, | my brother defying;
POEM	That would wide | in the world be known,
POEM	And sorrow for many | a man would make.
POEM	
POEM	39. "But the bond at last | I let be made,
POEM	For more the hoard | I longed to have,
POEM	The rings that the son | of Sigmund won;
POEM	No other's treasure | e'er I sought.
POEM	
POEM	40. "One-alone | of all I loved,
POEM	Nor changing heart | I ever had;
POEM	All in the end | shall Atli know,
POEM	When he hears I have gone | on the death-road hence."
POEM	* * * * * *
POEM	
POEM	41. "Never a wife | of fickle will
POEM	Yet to another | man should yield.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	So vengence for all | my ills shall come."
POEM	42, Up rose Gunnar, | the people's ruler,
POEM	And flung his arms | round her neck so fair;
POEM	And all who came, | of every kind,
POEM	Sought to hold her | with all their hearts.
POEM	
POEM	43. But back she cast | all those who came,
POEM	Nor from the long road | let them hold her;
POEM	In counsel then | did he Hogni call:
POEM	Of wisdom now | full great is our need.
POEM	
POEM	44. Let the warriors here | in the hall come forth,
POEM	Thine and mine, | for the need is mighty,
POEM	If haply the queen | from death they may hold,
POEM	Till her fearful thoughts | with time shall fade."
POEM	
POEM	45. (Few the words | of Hogni were:)
POEM	From the long road now | shall ye hold her not,
POEM	That born again | she may never be!
POEM	Foul she came | from her mother forth,
POEM	And born she was | for wicked deeds,
POEM	(Sorrow to many | a man to bring.)
POEM	
POEM	46. From the speaker gloomily | Gunnar turned,
POEM	For the jewel-bearer | her gems was dividing;
POEM	On all her wealth | her eyes were gazing,
POEM	On the bond-women slain | and the slaughtered slaves.
POEM	
POEM	47. Her byrnie of gold | she donned, and grim
POEM	Was her heart ere the point | of her sword had pierced it;
POEM	On the pillow at last | her head she laid,
POEM	And, wounded, her plan | she pondered o'er.
POEM	
POEM	48. "Hither I will | that my women come
POEM	Who gold are fain | from me to get;
POEM	Necklaces fashioned | fair to each
POEM	Shall I give, and cloth, | and garments bright."
POEM	
POEM	49. Silent were all | as so she spake,
POEM	And all together | answer made:
POEM	Slain are enough; | we seek to live,
POEM	Not thus thy women | shall honor win.
POEM	
POEM	50. Long the woman, | linen-decked, pondered,--
POEM	--Young she was,-- | and weighed her words:
POEM	For my sake now | shall none unwilling
POEM	Or loath to die | her life lay down.
POEM	
POEM	51. But little of gems | to gleam on your limbs
POEM	Ye then shall find | when forth ye fare
POEM	To follow me, | or of Menja's wealth.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	52. "Sit now, Gunnar! | for I shall speak
POEM	Of thy bride so fair | and so fain to die;
POEM	Thy ship in harbor | home thou hast not,
POEM	Although my life | I now have lost.
POEM	
POEM	53. "Thou shalt Guthrun requite | more quick than thou thinkest,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Though sadly mourns | the maiden wise
POEM	Who dwells with the king, | o'er her husband dead.
POEM	
POEM	54. "A maid shall then | the mother bear;
POEM	Brighter far | than the fairest day
POEM	Svanhild shall be, | or the beams of the sun.
POEM	
POEM	55. "Guthrun a noble | husband thou givest,
POEM	Yet to many a warrior | woe will she bring,
POEM	Not happily wedded | she holds herself;
POEM	Her shall Atli | hither seek,
POEM	(Buthli's son, | and brother of mine.)
POEM	
POEM	56. "Well I remember | how me ye treated
POEM	When ye betrayed me | with treacherous wiles;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Lost was my joy | as long as I lived.
POEM	
POEM	57. "Oddrun as wife | thou fain wouldst win,
POEM	But Atli this | from thee withholds;
POEM	Yet in secret tryst | ye twain shall love;
POEM	She shall hold thee dear, | as I had done
POEM	If kindly fate | to us had fallen.
POEM	
POEM	58. "Ill to thee | shall Atli bring,
POEM	When he casts thee down | in the den of snakes.
POEM	
POEM	59. "But soon thereafter | Atli too
POEM	His life, methinks, | as thou shalt lose,
POEM	(His fortune lose | and the lives of his sons;)
POEM	Him shall Guthrun, | grim of heart,
POEM	With the biting blade | in his bed destroy.
POEM	
POEM	60. "It would better beseem | thy sister fair
POEM	To follow her husband | first in death,
POEM	If counsel good | to her were given,
POEM	Or a heart akin | to mine she had.
POEM	
POEM	61. "Slowly I speak,-- | but for my sake
POEM	Her life, methinks, | she shall not lose;
POEM	She shall wander over | the tossing waves,
POEM	To where Jonak rules | his father's realm.
POEM	
POEM	62. "Sons to him | she soon shall bear,
POEM	Heirs therewith | of Jonak's wealth;
POEM	But Svanhild far | away is sent,
POEM	The child she bore | to Sigurth brave.
POEM	
POEM	63. "Bikki's word | her death shall be,
POEM	For dreadful the wrath | of Jormunrek;
POEM	So slain is all | of Sigurth's race,
POEM	And greater the woe | of Guthrun grows.
POEM	
POEM	64. "Yet one boon | I beg of thee,
POEM	The last of boons | in my life it is:
POEM	Let the pyre be built | so broad in the field
POEM	That room for us all | will ample be,
POEM	(For us who slain | with Sigurth are.)
POEM	
POEM	65. "With shields and carpets | cover the pyre,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Shrouds full fair, | and fallen slaves,
POEM	And besides the Hunnish | hero burn me.
POEM	
POEM	66. "Besides the Hunnish | hero there
POEM	Slaves shall burn, | full bravely decked,
POEM	Two at his head | and two at his feet,
POEM	A brace of hounds | and a pair of hawks,
POEM	For so shall all | be seemly done.
POEM	
POEM	67. "Let between us | lie once more
POEM	The steel so keen, | as so it lay
POEM	When both within | one bed we were,
POEM	And wedded mates | by men were called.
POEM	
POEM	68. "The door of the hall | shall strike not the heel
POEM	Of the hero fair | with flashing rings,
POEM	If hence my following | goes with him;
POEM	Not mean our faring | forth shall be.
POEM	
POEM	69. "Bond-women five | shall follow him,
POEM	And eight of my thralls, | well-born are they,
POEM	Children with me, | and mine they were
POEM	As gifts that Buthli | his daughter gave.
POEM	
POEM	70. "Much have I told thee, | and more would say
POEM	If fate more space | for speech had given;
POEM	My voice grows weak, | my wounds are swelling;
POEM	Truth I have said, | and so I die."
TITLE	HELREITH BRYNHILDAR
SUBTITLE	Brynhild's Hell-Ride
POEM	1. "Thou shalt not further | forward fare,
POEM	My dwelling ribbed | with rocks across;
POEM	More seemly it were | at thy weaving to stay,
POEM	Than another's husband | here to follow.
POEM	
POEM	2. "What wouldst thou have | from Valland here,
POEM	Fickle of heart, | in this my house?
POEM	Gold-goddess, now, | if thou wouldst know,
POEM	Heroes' blood | from thy hands hast washed."
POEM	
POEM	Brynhild spake:
POEM	3. "Chide me not, woman | from rocky walls,
POEM	Though to battle once | I was wont to go;
POEM	Better than thou | I shall seem to be,
POEM	When men us two | shall truly know."
POEM	
POEM	The giantess spake:
POEM	4. "Thou wast, Brynhild, | Buthli's daughter,
POEM	For the worst of evils | born in the world;
POEM	To death thou hast given | Gjuki's children,
POEM	And laid their lofty | house full low."
POEM	
POEM	Brynhild spake:
POEM	5. "Truth from the wagon | here I tell thee,
POEM	Witless one, | if know thou wilt
POEM	How the heirs of Gjuki | gave me to be
POEM	joyless ever, | a breaker of oaths.
POEM	
POEM	6. "Hild the helmed | in Hlymdalir
POEM	They named me of old, | all they who knew me.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	7. "The monarch bold | the swan-robes bore
POEM	Of the sisters eight | beneath an oak;
POEM	Twelve winters I was, | if know thou wilt,
POEM	When oaths I yielded | the king so young.
POEM	
POEM	8. "Next I let | the leader of Goths,
POEM	Hjalmgunnar the old, | go down to hell,
POEM	And victory brought | to Autha's brother;
POEM	For this was Othin's | anger mighty.
POEM	
POEM	9. "He beset me with shields | in Skatalund,
POEM	Red and white, | their rims o'erlapped;
POEM	He bade that my sleep | should broken be
POEM	By him who fear | had nowhere found.
POEM	
POEM	10. "He let round my hall, | that southward looked,
POEM	The branches' foe | high-leaping burn;
POEM	Across it he bade | the hero come
POEM	Who brought me the gold | that Fafnir guarded
POEM	
POEM	11. On Grani rode | the giver of gold,
POEM	Where my foster-father | ruled his folk;
POEM	Best of all | he seemed to be,
POEM	The prince of the Danes, | when the people met.
POEM	
POEM	12. "Happy we slept, | one bed we had,
POEM	As he my brother | born had been;
POEM	Eight were the nights | when neither there
POEM	Loving hand | on the other laid.
POEM	
POEM	13. "Yet Guthrun reproached me, | Gjuki's daughter,
POEM	That I in Sigurth's | arms had slept;
POEM	Then did I hear | what I would were hid,
POEM	That they had betrayed me | in taking a mate.
POEM	
POEM	14. "Ever with grief | and all too long
POEM	Are men and women | born in the world;
POEM	But yet we shall live | our lives together,
POEM	Sigurth and I. | Sink down, Giantess!"
TITLE	GUTHRUNARKVITHA II, EN FORNA
SUBTITLE	The Second, or Old, Lay of Guthrun
POEM	1. A maid of maids | my mother bore me,
POEM	Bright in my bower, | my brothers I loved,
POEM	Till Gjuki dowered | me with gold,
POEM	Dowered with gold, | and to Sigurth gave me.
POEM	
POEM	2. So Sigurth rose | o'er Gjuki's sons
POEM	As the leek grows green | above the grass,
POEM	Or the stag o'er all | the beasts doth stand,
POEM	Or as glow-red gold | above silver gray.
POEM	
POEM	3. Till my brothers let me | no longer have
POEM	The best of heroes | my husband to be;
POEM	Sleep they could not, | or quarrels settle,
POEM	Till Sigurth they | at last had slain.
POEM	
POEM	4. From the Thing ran Grani | with thundering feet,
POEM	But thence did Sigurth | himself come never;
POEM	Covered with sweat | was the saddle-bearer,
POEM	Wont the warrior's | weight to bear.
POEM	
POEM	5. Weeping I sought | with Grani to speak,
POEM	With tear-wet cheeks | for the tale I asked;
POEM	The head of Grani | was bowed to the grass,
POEM	The steed knew well | his master was slain.
POEM	
POEM	6. Long I waited | and pondered well
POEM	Ere ever the king | for tidings I asked.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	7. His head bowed Gunnar, | but Hogni told
POEM	The news full sore | of Sigurth slain:
POEM	Hewed to death | at our hands he lies,
POEM	Gotthorm's slayer, | given to wolves.
POEM	
POEM	8. On the southern road | thou shalt Sigurth see,
POEM	Where hear thou canst | the ravens cry;
POEM	The eagles cry | as food they crave,
POEM	And about thy husband | wolves are howling."
POEM	
POEM	9. "Why dost thou, Hogni, | such a horror
POEM	Let me hear, | all joyless left?
POEM	Ravens yet | thy heart shall rend
POEM	In a land that never | thou hast known."
POEM	
POEM	10. Few the words | of Hogni were,
POEM	Bitter his heart | from heavy sorrow:
POEM	Greater, Guthrun, | thy grief shall be
POEM	If the ravens so | my heart shall rend.
POEM	
POEM	11. From him who spake | I turned me soon,
POEM	In the woods to find | what the wolves had left;
POEM	Tears I had not, | nor wrung my bands,
POEM	Nor wailing went, | as other women,
POEM	(When by Sigurth | slain I sat).
POEM	
POEM	12. Never so black | had seemed the night
POEM	As when in sorrow | by Sigurth I sat;
POEM	The wolves . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	13. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Best of all | methought 'twould be
POEM	If I my life | could only lose,
POEM	Or like to birch-wood | burned might be.
POEM	
POEM	14. From the mountain forth | five days I fared,
POEM	Till Hoalf's hall | so high I saw;
POEM	Seven half-years | with Thora I stayed,
POEM	Hokon's daughter, | in Denmark then.
POEM	
POEM	15. With gold she broidered, | to bring me joy,
POEM	Southern halls | and Danish swans;
POEM	On the tapestry wove we | warrior's deeds,
POEM	And the hero's thanes | on our handiwork;
POEM	(Flashing shields | and fighters armed,
POEM	Sword-throng, helm-throng, | the host of the king).
POEM	
POEM	16. Sigmund's ship | by the land was sailing,
POEM	Golden the figure-head, | gay the beaks;
POEM	On board we wove | the warriors faring,
POEM	Sigar and Siggeir, | south to Fjon.
POEM	
POEM	17. Then Grimhild asked, | the Gothic queen,
POEM	Whether willingly would I . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	18. Her needlework cast she | aside, and called
POEM	Her sons to ask, | with stern resolve,
POEM	Who amends to their sister | would make for her son,
POEM	Or the wife requite | for her husband killed.
POEM	
POEM	19. Ready was Gunnar | gold to give,
POEM	Amends for my hurt, | and Hogni too;
POEM	Then would she know | who now would go,
POEM	The horse to saddle, | the wagon to harness,
POEM	(The horse to ride, | the hawk to fly,
POEM	And shafts from bows | of yew to shoot).
POEM	
POEM	20. (Valdar, king | of the Danes, was come,
POEM	With Jarizleif, Eymoth, | and Jarizskar).
POEM	In like princes | came they all,
POEM	The long-beard men, | with mantles red,
POEM	Short their mail-coats, | mighty their helms,
POEM	Swords at their belts, | and brown their hair.
POEM	
POEM	21. Each to give me | gifts was fain,
POEM	Gifts to give, | and goodly speech,
POEM	Comfort so | for my sorrows great
POEM	To bring they tried, | but I trusted them not.
POEM	
POEM	22. A draught did Grimhild | give me to drink,
POEM	Bitter and cold; | I forgot my cares;
POEM	For mingled therein was magic earth,
POEM	Ice-cold sea, and the blood of swine.
POEM	
POEM	23. In the cup were runes of every kind,
POEM	Written and reddened, I could not read them;
POEM	A heather-fish from the Haddings' land,
POEM	An ear uncut, and the entrails of beasts.
POEM	
POEM	24. Much evil was brewed within the beer,
POEM	Blossoms of trees, and acorns burned,
POEM	Dew of the hearth, and holy entrails,
POEM	The liver of swine,-- all grief to allay.
POEM	
POEM	25. Then I forgot, when the draught they gave me,
POEM	There in the hall, my husband's slaying;
POEM	On their knees the kings all three did kneel,
POEM	Ere she herself to speak began:
POEM	
POEM	26. "Guthrun, gold | to thee I give,
POEM	The wealth that once | thy father's was,
POEM	Rings to have, | and Hlothver's halls,
POEM	And the hangings all | that the monarch had.
POEM	
POEM	27. "Hunnish women, | skilled in weaving,
POEM	Who gold make fair | to give thee joy,
POEM	And the wealth of Buthli | thine shall be,
POEM	Gold-decked one, | as Atli's wife."
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	28. "A husband now | I will not have,
POEM	Nor wife of Brynhild's | brother be;
POEM	It beseems me not | with Buthli's son
POEM	Happy to be, | and heirs to bear."
POEM	
POEM	Grimhild spake:
POEM	29. "Seek not on men | to avenge thy sorrows,
POEM	Though the blame at first | with us hath been;
POEM	Happy shalt be | as if both still lived,
POEM	Sigurth and Sigmund, | if sons thou bearest."
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	30. "Grimhild, I may not | gladness find,
POEM	Nor hold forth hopes | to heroes now,
POEM	Since once the raven | and ravening wolf
POEM	Sigurth's heart's-blood | hungrily lapped."
POEM	
POEM	Grimhild spake:
POEM	31. "Noblest of birth | is the ruler now
POEM	I have found for thee, | and foremost of all;
POEM	Him shalt thou have | while life thou hast,
POEM	Or husbandless be | if him thou wilt choose not."
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	32. "Seek not so eagerly | me to send
POEM	To be a bride | of yon baneful race;
POEM	On Gunnar first | his wrath shall fall,
POEM	And the heart will he tear | from Hogni's breast."
POEM	
POEM	33. Weeping Grimhild | heard the words
POEM	That fate full sore | for her sons foretold,
POEM	(And mighty woe | for them should work;)
POEM	Lands I give thee, | with all that live there,
POEM	(Vinbjorg is thine, | and Valbjorg too,)
POEM	Have them forever, | but hear me, daughter.
POEM	
POEM	34. So must I do | as the kings besought,
POEM	And against my will | for my kinsmen wed,
POEM	Ne'er with my husband | joy I had,
POEM	And my sons by my brothers' | fate were saved not.
POEM	
POEM	35. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	I could not rest | till of life I had robbed
POEM	The warrior bold, | the maker of battles.
POEM	
POEM	36. Soon on horseback | each hero was,
POEM	And the foreign women | in wagons faring;
POEM	A week through lands | so cold we went,
POEM	And a second week | the waves we smote,
POEM	(And a third through lands | that water lacked).
POEM	
POEM	37. The warders now | on the lofty walls
POEM	Opened the gates, | and in we rode.
POEM	* * * * * *
POEM	
POEM	38. Atli woke me, | for ever I seemed
POEM	Of bitterness full | for my brothers' death.
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	39. "Now from sleep | the Norris have waked me
POEM	With visions of terror,-- | to thee will I tell them;
POEM	Methought thou, Guthrun, | Gjuki's daughter,
POEM	With poisoned blade | didst pierce my body."
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	40. "Fire a dream | of steel shall follow
POEM	And willful pride | one of woman's wrath;
POEM	A baneful sore | I shall burn from thee,
POEM	And tend and heal thee, | though hated thou am"
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	41. "Of plants I dreamed, | in the garden drooping,
POEM	That fain would I have | full high to grow;
POEM	Plucked by the roots, | and red with blood,
POEM	They brought them hither, | and bade me eat.
POEM	
POEM	42. "I dreamed my hawks | from my hand had flown,
POEM	Eager for food, | to an evil house;
POEM	I dreamed their hearts | with honey I ate,
POEM	Soaked in blood, | and heavy my sorrow.
POEM	
POEM	43. "Hounds I dreamed | from my hand I loosed,
POEM	Loud in hunger | and pain they howled;
POEM	Their flesh methought | was eagles' food,
POEM	And their bodies now | I needs must eat."
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	44. "Men shall soon | of sacrifice speak,
POEM	And off the heads | of beasts shall hew
POEM	Die they shall | ere day has dawned,
POEM	A few nights hence, | and the folk shall have them."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	45. "On my bed I sank, | nor slumber sought,
POEM	Weary with woe,-- | full well I remember.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
TITLE	GUTHRUNARKVITHA III
SUBTITLE	The Third Lay of Guthrun
POEM	1. "What thy sorrow, Atli, | Buthli's son?
POEM	Is thy heart heavy-laden? | Why laughest thou never?
POEM	It would better befit | the warrior far
POEM	To speak with men, | and me to look on."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	2. "It troubles me, Guthrun, | Gjuki's daughter,
POEM	What Herkja here | in the hall hath told me,
POEM	That thou in the bed | with Thjothrek liest,
POEM	Beneath the linen | in lovers' guise."
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	3. "This shall I | with oaths now swear,
POEM	Swear by the sacred | stone so white,
POEM	That nought was there | with Thjothmar's son
POEM	That man or woman | may not know.
POEM	
POEM	4. "Nor ever once | did my arms embrace
POEM	The hero brave, | the leader of hosts;
POEM	In another manner | our meeting was,
POEM	When our sorrows we | in secret told.
POEM	
POEM	5. "With thirty warriors | Thjothrek came,
POEM	Nor of all his men | doth one remain;
POEM	Thou hast murdered my brothers | and mail-clad men,
POEM	Thou hast murdered all | the men of my race.
POEM	
POEM	6. "Gunnar comes not, | Hogni I greet not,
POEM	No longer I see | my brothers loved;
POEM	My sorrow would Hogni | avenge with the sword,
POEM	Now myself for my woes | I shall payment win.
POEM	
POEM	7. "Summon Saxi, | the southrons' king,
POEM	For be the boiling | kettle can hallow."
POEM	Seven hundred | there were in the hall,
POEM	Ere the queen her hand | in the kettle thrust.
POEM	
POEM	8. To the bottom she reached | with hand so bright,
POEM	And forth she brought | the flashing stones:
POEM	Behold, ye warriors, | well am I cleared
POEM	Of sin by the kettle's | sacred boiling.
POEM	
POEM	9. Then Atli's heart | in happiness laughed,
POEM	When Guthrun's hand | unhurt he saw;
POEM	Now Herkja shall come | the kettle to try,
POEM	She who grief | for Guthrun planned.
POEM	
POEM	10. Ne'er saw man sight | more sad than this,
POEM	How burned were the hands | of Herkja then;
POEM	In a bog so foul | the maid they flung,
POEM	And so was Guthrun's | grief requited.
TITLE	ODDRUNARGRATR
SUBTITLE	The Lament of Oddrun
POEM	1. I have heard it told | in olden tales
POEM	How a maiden came | to Morningland;
POEM	No one of all | on earth above
POEM	To Heithrek's daughter | help could give.
POEM	
POEM	2. This Oddrun learned, | the sister of Atli,
POEM	That sore the maiden's | sickness was;
POEM	The bit-bearer forth | from his stall she brought,
POEM	And the saddle laid | on the steed so black.
POEM	
POEM	3. She let the horse go | o'er the level ground,
POEM	Till she reached the hall | that loftily rose,
POEM	(And in she went | from the end of the hall;)
POEM	From the weary steed | the saddle she took;
POEM	
POEM	Hear now the speech | that first she spake:
POEM	4. "What news on earth, | . . . . .
POEM	Or what has happened | in Hunland now?"
POEM	
POEM	A serving-maid spake:
POEM	Here Borgny lies | in bitter pain,
POEM	Thy friend, and, Oddrun, | thy help would find.
POEM	
POEM	Oddrun spake:
POEM	5. 'Who worked this woe | for the woman thus,
POEM	Or why so sudden | is Borgny sick?"
POEM	
POEM	The serving-maid spake:
POEM	Vilmund is he, | the heroes' friend,
POEM	Who wrapped the woman | in bedclothes warm,
POEM	(For winters five, | yet her father knew not).
POEM	
POEM	6. Then no more | they spake, methinks;
POEM	She went at the knees | of the woman to sit;
POEM	With magic Oddrun | and mightily Oddrun
POEM	Chanted for Borgny | potent charms.
POEM	
POEM	7. At last were born | a boy and girl,
POEM	Son and daughter | of Hogni's slayer;
POEM	Then speech the woman | so weak began,
POEM	
POEM	Nor said she aught | ere this she spake:
POEM	8. "So may the holy | ones thee help,
POEM	Frigg and Freyja | and favoring gods,
POEM	As thou hast saved me | from sorrow now."
POEM	
POEM	Oddrun spake:
POEM	9. "I came not hither | to help thee thus
POEM	Because thou ever | my aid didst earn;
POEM	I fulfilled the oath | that of old I swore,
POEM	That aid to all | I should ever bring,
POEM	(When they shared the wealth | the warriors had)."
POEM	
POEM	Borgny spake:
POEM	10. "Wild art thou, Oddrun, | and witless now,
POEM	That so in hatred | to me thou speakest;
POEM	I followed thee | where thou didst fare,
POEM	As we had been born | of brothers twain."
POEM	
POEM	Oddrun spake:
POEM	11. "I remember the evil | one eve thou spakest,
POEM	When a draught I gave | to Gunnar then;
POEM	Thou didst say that never | such a deed
POEM	By maid was done | save by me alone."
POEM	
POEM	12. Then the sorrowing woman | sat her down
POEM	To tell the grief | of her troubles great.
POEM	
POEM	13. "Happy I grew | in the hero's hall
POEM	As the warriors wished, | and they loved me well;
POEM	Glad I was | of my father's gifts,
POEM	For winters five, | while my father lived.
POEM	
POEM	14. "These were the words | the weary king,
POEM	
POEM	Ere he died, | spake last of all:
POEM	He bade me with red gold | dowered to be,
POEM	And to Grimhild's son | in the South be wedded.
POEM	
POEM	15. "But Brynhild the helm | he bade to wear,
POEM	A wish-maid bright | he said she should be;
POEM	For a nobler maid | would never be born
POEM	On earth, he said, | if death should spare her.
POEM	
POEM	16. "At her weaving Brynhild | sat in her bower,
POEM	Lands and folk | alike she had;
POEM	The earth and heaven | high resounded
POEM	When Fafnir's slayer | the city saw.
POEM	
POEM	17. "Then battle was fought | with the foreign swords,
POEM	And the city was broken | that Brynhild had;
POEM	Not long thereafter, | but all too soon,
POEM	Their evil wiles | full well she knew.
POEM	
POEM	18. "Woeful for this | her vengeance was,
POEM	As so we learned | to our sorrow all;
POEM	In every land | shall all men hear
POEM	How herself at Sigurth's | side she slew.
POEM	
POEM	19. "Love to Gunnar | then I gave,
POEM	To the breaker of rings, | as Brynhild might;
POEM	To Atli rings | so red they offered,
POEM	And mighty gifts | to my brother would give.
POEM	
POEM	20. "Fifteen dwellings | fain would he give
POEM	For me, and the burden | that Grani bore;
POEM	But Atli said | he would never receive
POEM	Marriage gold | from Gjuki's son.
POEM	
POEM	21. "Yet could we not | our love o'ercome,
POEM	And my head I laid | on the hero's shoulder;
POEM	Many there were | of kinsmen mine
POEM	Who said that together | us they had seen.
POEM	
POEM	22. "Atli said | that never I
POEM	Would evil plan, | or ill deed do;
POEM	But none may this | of another think,
POEM	Or surely speak, | when love is shared.
POEM	
POEM	23. "Soon his men | did Atli send,
POEM	In the murky wood | on me to spy;
POEM	Thither they came | where they should not come,
POEM	Where beneath one cover | close we lay.
POEM	
POEM	24. "To the warriors ruddy | rings we offered,
POEM	That nought to Atli | e'er they should say;
POEM	But swiftly home | they hastened thence,
POEM	And eager all | to Atli told.
POEM	
POEM	25. "But close from Guthrun | kept they hid
POEM	What first of all | she ought to have known.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	26. "Great was the clatter | of gilded hoofs
POEM	When Gjuki's sons | through the gateway rode;
POEM	The heart they hewed | from Hogni then,
POEM	And the other they cast | in the serpents' cave.
POEM	
POEM	27. "The hero wise | on his harp then smote,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	For help from me | in his heart yet hoped
POEM	The high-born king, | might come to him.
POEM	
POEM	28. "Alone was I gone | to Geirmund then,
POEM	The draught to mix | and ready to make;
POEM	Sudden I heard | from Hlesey clear
POEM	How in sorrow the strings | of the harp resounded.
POEM	
POEM	29. "I bade the serving-maids | ready to be,
POEM	For I longed the hero's | life to save;
POEM	Across the sound | the boats we sailed,
POEM	Till we saw the whole | of Atli's home.
POEM	
POEM	30. "Then crawling the evil | woman came,
POEM	Atli's mother-- | may she ever rot!
POEM	And hard she bit | to Gunnar's heart,
POEM	So I could not help | the hero brave.
POEM	
POEM	31. "Oft have I wondered | how after this,
POEM	Serpents'-bed goddess! | I still might live,
POEM	For well I loved | the warrior brave,
POEM	The giver of swords, | as my very self.
POEM	
POEM	32. "Thou didst see and listen, | the while I said
POEM	The mighty grief | that was mine and theirs;
POEM	Each man lives | as his longing wills,--
POEM	Oddrun's lament | is ended now."
TITLE	ATLAKVITHA EN GRÖNLENZKA
SUBTITLE	The Greenland Lay of Atli
POEM	1. Atli sent | of old to Gunnar
POEM	A keen-witted rider, | Knefröth did men call him;
POEM	To Gjuki's home came he | and to Gunnar's dwelling,
POEM	With benches round the hearth, | and to the beer so sweet.
POEM	
POEM	2. Then the followers, hiding | their falseness, all drank
POEM	Their wine in the war-hall, | of the Huns' wrath wary;
POEM	And Knefröth spake loudly, | his words were crafty,
POEM	The hero from the south, | on the high bench sitting:
POEM	
POEM	3. "Now Atli has sent me | his errand to ride,
POEM	On my bit-champing steed | through Myrkwood the secret,
POEM	To bid You, Gunnar, | to his benches to come,
POEM	With helms round the hearth, | and Atli's home seek.
POEM	
POEM	4. "Shields shall ye choose there, | and shafts made of ash-wood,
POEM	Gold-adorned helmets, | and slaves out of Hunland,
POEM	Silver-gilt saddle-cloths, | shirts of bright scarlet,
POEM	With lances and spears too, | and bit-champing steeds.
POEM	
POEM	5. "The field shall be given you | of wide Gnitaheith,
POEM	With loud-ringing lances, | and stems gold-o'er-laid,
POEM	Treasures full huge, | and the home of Danp,
POEM	And the mighty forest | that Myrkwood is called."
POEM	
POEM	6. His head turned Gunnar, | and to Hogni he said:
POEM	What thy counsel, young hero, | when such things we hear?
POEM	No gold do I know | on Gnitaheith lying
POEM	So fair that other | its equal we have not.
POEM	
POEM	7. We have seven halls, | each of swords is full,
POEM	(And all of gold | is the hilt of each;)
POEM	My steed is the swiftest, | my sword is sharpest,
POEM	My bows adorn benches, | my byrnies are golden,
POEM	My helm is the brightest | that came from Kjar's hall,
POEM	(Mine own is better | than all the Huns' treasure.)"
POEM	
POEM	Hogni spake:
POEM	8. "What seeks she to say, | that she sends us a ring,
POEM	Woven with a wolf's hair? | methinks it gives warning;
POEM	In the red ring a hair | of the heath-dweller found I,
POEM	Wolf-like shall our road be | if we ride on this journey."
POEM	
POEM	9. Not eager were his comrades, | nor the men of his kin,
POEM	The wise nor the wary, | nor the warriors bold.
POEM	But Gunnar spake forth | as befitted a king,
POEM	Noble in the beer-hall, | and bitter his scorn:
POEM	
POEM	10. "Stand forth now, Fjornir! | and hither on the floor
POEM	The beakers all golden | shalt thou bring to the warriors.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	11. "The wolves then shall rule | the wealth of the Niflungs,
POEM	Wolves aged and grey-hued, | if Gunnar is lost,
POEM	And black-coated bears | with rending teeth bite,
POEM	And make glad the dogs, | if Gunnar returns not."
POEM	
POEM	12. A following gallant | fared forth with the ruler,
POEM	Yet they wept as their home | with the hero they left;
POEM	And the little heir | of Hogni called loudly:
POEM	Go safe now, ye wise ones, | wherever ye will!
POEM	
POEM	13. Then let the bold heroes | their bit-champing horses
POEM	On the mountains gallop, | and through Myrkwood the secret;
POEM	All Hunland was shaken | where the hard-souled ones rode,
POEM	On the whip-fearers fared they | through fields that were green.
POEM	
POEM	14. Then they saw Atli's halls, | and his watch-towers high,
POEM	On the walls so lofty | stood the warriors of Buthli;
POEM	The hall of the southrons | with seats was surrounded,
POEM	With targets bound | and shields full bright.
POEM	
POEM	15. Mid weapons and lances | did Atli his wine
POEM	In the war-hall drink, | without were his watchmen,
POEM	For Gunnar they waited, | if forth he should go,
POEM	With their ringing spears | they would fight with the ruler.
POEM	
POEM	16. This their sister saw, | as soon as her brothers
POEM	Had entered the hall,-- | little ale had she drunk:
POEM	Betrayed art thou, Gunnar! | what guard hast thou, hero,
POEM	Gainst the plots of the Huns? | from the hall flee swiftly!
POEM	
POEM	17. Brother, 'twere far better | to have come in byrnie,
POEM	With thy household helmed, | to see Atli's home,
POEM	And to sit in the saddle | all day 'neath the sun,
POEM	(That the sword-norns might weep | for the death-pale warriors,
POEM	And the Hunnish shield-maids | might shun not the sword,)
POEM	And send Atli himself | to the den of the snakes;
POEM	(Now the den of the snakes | for thee is destined.
POEM	
POEM	Gunnar spake:
POEM	18. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Too late is it, sister, | to summon the Niflungs,
POEM	Long is it to come | to the throng of our comrades,
POEM	The heroes gallant, | from the hills of the Rhine.
POEM	* * * * * *
POEM	
POEM	19. Then Gunnar they seized, | and they set him in chains,
POEM	The Burgundians' king, | and fast they bound him.
POEM	
POEM	20. Hogni slew seven | with sword so keen,
POEM	And an eighth he flung | in the fire hot;
POEM	A hero should fight | with his foemen thus,
POEM	As Hogni strove | in Gunnar's behalf.
POEM	
POEM	21. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	The leader they asked | if his life he fain
POEM	With gold would buy, | the king of the Goths.
POEM	
POEM	Gunnar spake:
POEM	22. "First the heart of Hogni | shall ye lay in my hands,
POEM	All bloody from the breast | of the bold one cut
POEM	With ke-en-biting sword, | from the son of the king."
POEM	
POEM	23. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	They cut out the heart | from the breast of Hjalli,
POEM	On a platter they bore it, | and brought it to Gunnar.
POEM	
POEM	24. Then Gunnar spake forth, | the lord of the folk:
POEM	Here have I the heart | of Hjalli the craven,
POEM	Unlike to the heart | of Hogni the valiant,
POEM	For it trembles still | as it stands on the platter;
POEM	Twice more did it tremble | in the breast of the man.
POEM	
POEM	25. Then Hogni laughed | when they cut out the heart
POEM	Of the living helm-hammerer; | tears he had not.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	On a platter they bore it, | and brought it to Gunnar.
POEM	
POEM	26. Then Gunnar spake forth, | the spear of the Niflungs:
POEM	Here have I the heart | of Hogni the valiant,
POEM	Unlike to the heart | of Hjalli the craven,
POEM	Little it trembles | as it lies on the platter,
POEM	Still less did it tremble | when it lay in his breast.
POEM	
POEM	27. "So distant, Atli, | from all men's eyes,
POEM	Shalt thou be as thou | . . . . . from the gold.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	28. "To no one save me | is the secret known
POEM	Of the Niflungs' hoard, | now Hogni is dead;
POEM	Of old there were two, | while we twain were alive,
POEM	Now is none but I, | for I only am living.
POEM	
POEM	29. "The swift Rhine shall hold | the strife-gold of heroes,
POEM	That once was the gods', | the wealth of the Niflungs,
POEM	In the depths of the waters | the death-rings shall glitter,
POEM	And not shine on the hands | of the Hunnish men."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	30. "Ye shall bring the wagon, | for now is he bound."
POEM	* * * * * *
POEM	
POEM	31. On the long-maned Glaum | rode Atli the great,
POEM	About him were warriors | . . . . .
POEM	But Guthrun, akin | to the gods of slaughter,
POEM	Yielded not to her tears | in the hall of tumult.
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	32. "It shall go with thee, Atli, | as with Gunnar thou heldest
POEM	The oaths ofttimes sworn, | and of old made firm,
POEM	By the sun in the south, | by Sigtyr's mountain,
POEM	By the horse of the rest-bed, | and the ring of Ull."
POEM	
POEM	33. Then the champer of bits | drew the chieftain great,
POEM	The gold-guarder, down | to the place of death.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	34. By the warriors' host | was the living hero
POEM	Cast in the den | where crawling about
POEM	Within were serpents, | but soon did Gunnar
POEM	With his hand in wrath | on the harp-strings smite;
POEM	The strings resounded,-- | so shall a hero,
POEM	A ring-breaker, gold | from his enemies guard.
POEM	
POEM	35. Then Atli rode | on his earth-treading steed,
POEM	Seeking his home, | from the slaughter-place;
POEM	There was clatter of hoofs | of the steeds in the court,
POEM	And the clashing of arms | as they came from the field.
POEM	
POEM	36. Out then came Guthrun | to meeting with Atli,
POEM	With a golden beaker | as gift to the monarch:
POEM	Thou mayst eat now, chieftain, | within thy dwelling,
POEM	Blithely with Guthrun | young beasts fresh slaughtered.
POEM	
POEM	37. The wine-heavy ale-cups | of Atli resounded,
POEM	When there in the hall | the Hunnish youths clamored,
POEM	And the warriors bearded, | the brave ones, entered.
POEM	
POEM	38. Then in came the shining one, | . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . | and drink she bore them;
POEM	Unwilling and bitter | brought she food to the warrior,
POEM	Till in scorn to the white-faced | Atli did she speak:
POEM	
POEM	39. "Thou giver of swords, | of thy sons the hearts
POEM	All heavy with blood | in honey thou hast eaten;
POEM	Thou shalt stomach, thou hero, | the flesh of the slain,
POEM	To eat at thy feast, | and to send to thy followers.
POEM	
POEM	40. "Thou shalt never call | to thy knees again
POEM	Erp or Eitil, | when merry with ale;
POEM	Thou shalt never see | in their seats again
POEM	The sharers of gold | their lances shaping,
POEM	(Clipping the manes | or minding their steeds.)"
POEM	
POEM	41. There was clamor on the benches, | and the cry of men,
POEM	The clashing of weapons, | and weeping of the Huns,
POEM	Save for Guthrun only, | she wept not ever
POEM	For her bear-fierce brothers, | or the boys so dear,
POEM	So young and so unhappy, | whom with Atli she had.
POEM	
POEM	42. Gold did she scatter, | the swan-white one,
POEM	And rings of red gold | to the followers gave she;
POEM	The fate she let grow, | and the shining wealth go,
POEM	Nor spared she the treasure | of the temple itself.
POEM	
POEM	43. Unwise then was Atli, | he had drunk to wildness,
POEM	No weapon did he have, | and of Guthrun bewared not;
POEM	Oft their play was better | when both in gladness
POEM	Each other embraced | among princes all.
POEM	
POEM	44. With her sword she gave blood | for the bed to drink,
POEM	With her death-dealing hand, | and the hounds she loosed,
POEM	The thralls she awakened, | and a firebrand threw
POEM	In the door of the hall; | so vengeance she had.
POEM	
POEM	45. To the flames she gave all | who yet were within,
POEM	And from Myrkheim had come | from the murder of Gunnar;
POEM	The timbers old fell, | the temple was in flames,
POEM	The dwelling of the Buthlungs, | and the shield-maids burned,
POEM	They were slain in the house, | in the hot flames they sank.
POEM	
POEM	46. Now the tale is all told, | nor in later time
POEM	Will a woman in byrnie | avenge so her brothers;
POEM	The fair one to three | of the kings of the folk
POEM	Brought the doom of death | ere herself she died.
POEM	Still more is told in the Greenland ballad of Atli.
TITLE	GUTHRUNARHVOT
SUBTITLE	Guthrun's Inciting
POEM	1. A word-strife I learned, | most woeful of all,
POEM	A speech from the fullness | of sorrow spoken,
POEM	When fierce of heart | her sons to the fight
POEM	Did Guthrun whet | with words full grim.
POEM	
POEM	2. "Why sit ye idle, | why sleep out your lives,
POEM	Why grieve ye not | in gladness to speak?
POEM	Since Jormunrek | your sister young
POEM	Beneath the hoofs | of horses hath trodden,
POEM	(White and black | on the battle-way,
POEM	Gray, road-wonted, | the steeds of the Goths.)
POEM	
POEM	3. "Not like are ye | to Gunnar of yore,
POEM	Nor have ye hearts | such as Hogni's was;
POEM	Vengeance for her | ye soon would have
POEM	If brave ye were | as my brothers of old,
POEM	Or hard your hearts | as the Hunnish kings'."
POEM	
POEM	4. Then Hamther spake, | the high of heart:
POEM	Little the deed | of Hogni didst love,
POEM	When Sigurth they wakened | from his sleep;
POEM	Thy bed-covers white | were red with blood
POEM	Of thy husband, drenched | with gore from his heart.
POEM	
POEM	5. Bloody revenge | didst have for thy brothers,
POEM	Evil and sore, | when thy sons didst slay;
POEM	Else yet might we all | on Jormunrek
POEM	Together our sister's | slaying avenge.
POEM	
POEM	6. . . . . . . . . . .
POEM	The gear of the Hunnish | kings now give us!
POEM	Thou hast whetted us so | to the battle of swords."
POEM	
POEM	7. Laughing did Guthrun | go to her chamber,
POEM	The helms of the kings | from the cupboards she took,
POEM	And mail-coats broad, | to her sons she bore them;
POEM	On their horses' backs | the heroes leaped.
POEM	
POEM	8. Then Hamther spake, | the high of heart:
POEM	Homeward no more | his mother to see
POEM	Comes the spear-god, | fallen mid Gothic folk;
POEM	One death-draught thou | for us all shalt drink,
POEM	For Svanhild then | and thy sons as well.
POEM	
POEM	9. Weeping Guthrun, | Gjuki's daughter,
POEM	Went sadly before | the gate to sit,
POEM	And with tear-stained cheeks | to tell the tale
POEM	Of her mighty griefs, | so many in kind.
POEM	
POEM	10. "Three home-fires knew I, | three hearths I knew,
POEM	Home was I brought | by husbands three;
POEM	But Sigurth only | of all was dear,
POEM	He whom my brothers | brought to his death.
POEM	
POEM	11. "A greater sorrow | I saw not nor knew,
POEM	Yet more it seemed | I must suffer yet
POEM	When the princes great | to Atli gave me.
POEM	
POEM	12. "The brave boys I summoned | to secret speech;
POEM	For my woes requital | I might not win
POEM	Till off the heads | of the Hniflungs I hewed.
POEM	
POEM	13. "To the sea I went, | my heart full sore
POEM	For the Norns, whose wrath | I would now escape;
POEM	But the lofty billows | bore me undrowned,
POEM	Till to land I came, | so I longer must live.
POEM	
POEM	14. "Then to the bed-- | of old was it better!--
POEM	Of a king of the folk | a third time I came;
POEM	Boys I bore | his heirs to be,
POEM	Heirs so young, | the sons of Jonak.
POEM	
POEM	15. "But round Svanhild | handmaidens sat,
POEM	She was dearest ever | of all my children;
POEM	So did Svanhild | seem in my hall
POEM	As the ray of the sun | is fair to see.
POEM	
POEM	16. "Gold I gave her | and garments bright,
POEM	Ere I let her go | to the Gothic folk;
POEM	Of my heavy woes | the hardest it was
POEM	When Svanhild's tresses | fair were trodden
POEM	In the mire by hoofs | of horses wild.
POEM	
POEM	17. "The sorest it was | when Sigurth mine
POEM	On his couch, of victory | robbed, they killed;
POEM	And grimmest of all | when to Gunnar's heart
POEM	There crept the bright-hued | crawling snakes.
POEM	
POEM	18. "And keenest of all | when they cut the heart
POEM	From the living breast | of the king so brave;
POEM	Many woes I remember, | . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	19. "Bridle, Sigurth, | thy steed so black,
POEM	Hither let run | thy swift-faring horse;
POEM	Here there sits not | son or daughter
POEM	Who yet to Guthrun | gifts shall give.
POEM	
POEM	20. "Remember, Sigurth, | what once we said,
POEM	When together both | on the bed we sat,
POEM	That mightily thou | to me wouldst come
POEM	From hell and I | from earth to thee.
POEM	
POEM	21. "Pile ye up, jarls, | the pyre of oak,
POEM	Make it the highest | a hero e'er had;
POEM	Let the fire burn | my grief-filled breast,
POEM	My sore-pressed heart, | till my sorrows melt."
POEM	
POEM	22. May nobles all | less sorrow know,
POEM	And less the woes | of women become,
POEM	Since the tale of this | lament is told.
TITLE	HAMTHESMOL
SUBTITLE	The Ballad of Hamther
POEM	1. Great the evils | once that grew,
POEM	With the dawning sad | of the sorrow of elves;
POEM	In early mom | awake for men
POEM	The evils that grief | to each shall bring.
POEM	
POEM	2. Not now, nor yet | of yesterday was it,
POEM	Long the time | that since hath lapsed,
POEM	So that little there is | that is half as old,
POEM	Since Guthrun, daughter | of Gjuki, whetted
POEM	Her sons so young | to Svanhild's vengeance.
POEM	
POEM	3. "The sister ye had | was Svanhild called,
POEM	And her did Jormunrek | trample with horses,
POEM	White and black | on the battle-way,
POEM	Gray, road-wonted, | the steeds of the Goths.
POEM	
POEM	4. "Little the kings | of the folk are ye like,
POEM	For now ye are living | alone of my race.
POEM	
POEM	5. "Lonely am I | as the forest aspen,
POEM	Of kindred bare | as the fir of its boughs,
POEM	My joys are all lost | as the leaves of the tree
POEM	When the scather of twigs | from the warm day turns."
POEM	
POEM	6. Then Hamther spake forth, | the high of heart:
POEM	Small praise didst thou, Guthrun, | to Hogni's deed give
POEM	When they wakened thy Sigurth | from out of his sleep,
POEM	Thou didst sit on the bed | while his slayers laughed.
POEM	
POEM	7. Thy bed-covers white | with blood were red
POEM	From his wounds, and with gore | of thy husband were wet;
POEM	So Sigurth was slain, | by his corpse didst thou sit,
POEM	And of gladness didst think not: | 'twas Gunnar's doing.
POEM	
POEM	8. "Thou wouldst strike at Atli | by the slaying of Erp
POEM	And the killing of Eitil; | thine own grief was worse;
POEM	So should each one wield | the wound-biting sword
POEM	That another it slays | but smites not himself."
POEM	
POEM	9. Then did Sorli speak out, | for wise was he ever:
POEM	With my mother I never | a quarrel will make;
POEM	Full little in speaking | methinks ye both lack;
POEM	What askest thou, Guthrun, | that will give thee no tears?
POEM	
POEM	10. For thy brothers dost weep, | and thy boys so sweet,
POEM	Thy kinsmen in birth | on the battlefield slain;
POEM	Now, Guthrun, as; well | for us both shalt thou weep,
POEM	We sit doomed on our steeds, | and far hence shall we die."
POEM	
POEM	11. Then the fame-glad one-- | on the steps she was--
POEM	
POEM	The slender-fingered, | spake with her son:
POEM	Ye shall danger have | if counsel ye heed not;
POEM	By two heroes alone | shall two hundred of Goths
POEM	Be bound or be slain | in the lofty-walled burg.
POEM	
POEM	12. From the courtyard they fared, | and fury they breathed;
POEM	The youths swiftly went | o'er the mountain wet,
POEM	On their Hunnish steeds, | death's vengeance to have.
POEM	
POEM	13. On the way they found | the man so wise;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	What help from the weakling | brown may we have?
POEM	
POEM	14. So answered them | their half-brother then:
POEM	So well may I | my kinsmen aid
POEM	As help one foot | from the other has.
POEM	
POEM	15. "How may afoot | its fellow aid,
POEM	Or a flesh-grown hand | another help?"
POEM	
POEM	16. Then Erp spake forth, | his words were few,
POEM	As haughty he sat | on his horse's back:
POEM	To the timid 'tis ill | the way to tell.
POEM	A bastard they | the bold one called.
POEM	
POEM	17. From their sheaths they drew | their shining swords,
POEM	Their blades, to the giantess | joy to give;
POEM	By a third they lessened | the might that was theirs,
POEM	The fighter young | to earth they felled.
POEM	
POEM	18. Their cloaks they shook, | their swords they sheathed,
POEM	The high-born men | wrapped their mantles close.
POEM	
POEM	19. On their road they fared | and an ill way found,
POEM	And their sister's son | on a tree they saw,
POEM	On the wind-cold wolf-tree | west of the hall,
POEM	And cranes'-bait crawled; | none would care to linger.
POEM	
POEM	20. In the hall was din, | the men drank deep,
POEM	And the horses' hoofs | could no one hear,
POEM	Till the warrior hardy | sounded his horn.
POEM	
POEM	21. Men came and the tale | to Jormunrek told
POEM	How warriors helmed | without they beheld:
POEM	Take counsel wise, | for brave ones are come,
POEM	Of mighty men | thou the sister didst murder.
POEM	
POEM	22. Then Jormunrek laughed, | his hand laid on his beard,
POEM	His arms, for with wine | he was warlike, he called for;
POEM	He shook his brown locks, | on his white shield he looked,
POEM	And raised high the cup | of gold in his hand.
POEM	
POEM	23. "Happy, methinks, | were I to behold
POEM	Hamther and Sorli | here in my hall;
POEM	The men would I bind | with strings of bows,
POEM	And Gjuki's heirs | on the gallows hang."
POEM	
POEM	24. In the hall was clamor, | the cups were shattered,
POEM	Men stood in blood | from the breasts of the Goths,
POEM	
POEM	25. Then did Hamther speak forth, | the haughty of heart:
POEM	Thou soughtest, Jormunrek, | us to see,
POEM	Sons of one mother | seeking thy dwelling;
POEM	Thou seest thy hands, | thy feet thou beholdest,
POEM	Jormunrek, flung | in the fire so hot.
POEM	
POEM	26. Then roared the king, | of the race of the gods,
POEM	Bold in his armor, | as roars a bear:
POEM	Stone ye the men | that steel will bite not,
POEM	Sword nor spear, | the sons of Jonak.
POEM	
POEM	Sorli spake:
POEM	27. "Ill didst win, brother, | when the bag thou didst open,
POEM	Oft from that bag | came baleful counsel;
POEM	Heart hast thou, Hamther, | if knowledge thou hadst!
POEM	A man without wisdom | is lacking in much."
POEM	
POEM	Hamther spake:
POEM	28. "His head were now off | if Erp were living,
POEM	The brother so keen | whom we killed on our road,
POEM	The warrior noble,-- | 'twas the Norns that drove me
POEM	The hero to slay | who in fight should be holy.
POEM	
POEM	29. "In fashion of wolves | it befits us not
POEM	Amongst ourselves to strive,
POEM	Like the hounds of the Norns, | that nourished were
POEM	In greed mid wastes so grim.
POEM	
POEM	30. "We have greatly fought, | o'er the Goths do we stand
POEM	By our blades laid low, | like eagles on branches;
POEM	Great our fame though we die | today or tomorrow;
POEM	None outlives the night | when the Norris have spoken."
POEM	
POEM	31. Then Sorli beside | the gable sank,
POEM	And Hamther fell | at the back of the house.
POEM	This is called the old ballad of Hamther.
TITLE	ATLAMOL EN GRÖNLENZKU
SUBTITLE	The Greenland Ballad of Atli
POEM	1. There are many who know | how of old did men
POEM	In counsel gather; | little good did they get;
POEM	In secret they plotted, | it was sore for them later,
POEM	And for Gjuki's sons, | whose trust they deceived.
POEM	
POEM	2. Fate grew for the princes, | to death they were given;
POEM	Ill counsel was Atli's, | though keenness he had;
POEM	He felled his staunch bulwark, | his own sorrow fashioned,
POEM	Soon a message he sent | that his kinsmen should seek him.
POEM	
POEM	3. Wise was the woman, | she fain would use wisdom,
POEM	She saw well what meant | all they said in secret;
POEM	From her heart it was hid | how help she might render,
POEM	The sea they should sail, | while herself she should go not.
POEM	
POEM	4. Runes did she fashion, | but false Vingi made them,
POEM	The speeder of hatred, | ere to give them he sought;
POEM	Then soon fared the warriors | whom Atli had sent,
POEM	And to Limafjord came, | to the home of the kings.
POEM	
POEM	5. They were kindly with ale, | and fires they kindled,
POEM	They thought not of craft | from the guests who had come;
POEM	The gifts did they take | that the noble one gave them,
POEM	On the pillars they hung them, | no fear did they harbor.
POEM	
POEM	6. Forth did Kostbera, | wife of Hogni, then come,
POEM	Full kindly she was, | and she welcomed them both;
POEM	And glad too was Glaumvor, | the wife of Gunnar,
POEM	She knew well to care | for the needs of the guests.
POEM	
POEM	7. Then Hogni they asked | if more eager he were,
POEM	Full clear was the guile, | if on guard they had been;
POEM	Then Gunnar made promise, | if Hogni would go,
POEM	And Hogni made answer | as the other counseled.
POEM	
POEM	8. Then the famed ones brought mead, | and fair was the feast,
POEM	Full many were the horns, | till the men had drunk deep;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	Then the mates made ready | their beds for resting.
POEM	
POEM	9. Wise was Kostbera, | and cunning in rune-craft,
POEM	The letters would she read | by the light of the fire;
POEM	But full quickly her tongue | to her palate clave,
POEM	So strange did they seem | that their meaning she saw not.
POEM	
POEM	10. Full soon then his bed | came Hogni to seek,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	The clear-souled one dreamed, | and her dream she kept not,
POEM	
POEM	To the warrior the wise one | spake when she wakened:
POEM	11. "Thou wouldst go hence, | Hogni, but heed my counsel,--
POEM	Known to few are the runes,-- | and put off thy faring;
POEM	I have read now the runes | that thy sister wrote,
POEM	And this time the bright one | did not bid thee to come.
POEM	
POEM	12. "Full much do I wonder, | nor well can I see,
POEM	Why the woman wise | so wildly hath written;
POEM	But to me it seems | that the meaning beneath
POEM	Is that both shall be slain | if soon ye shall go.
POEM	But one rune she missed, | or else others have marred it."
POEM	
POEM	Hogni spake:
POEM	13. "All women are fearful; | not so do I feel,
POEM	Ill I seek not to find | till I soon must avenge it;
POEM	The king now will give us | the glow-ruddy gold;
POEM	I never shall fear, | though of dangers I know."
POEM	
POEM	Kostbera spake:
POEM	14. "In danger ye fare, | if forth ye go thither,
POEM	No welcoming friendly | this time shall ye find;
POEM	For I dreamed now, Hogni, | and nought will I hide,
POEM	Full evil thy faring, | if rightly I fear.
POEM	
POEM	15. "Thy bed-covering saw I | in the flames burning,
POEM	And the fire burst high | through the walls of my home."
POEM	
POEM	Hogni spake:
POEM	Yon garment of linen | lies little of worth,
POEM	It will soon be burned, | so thou sawest the bed-cover.
POEM	
POEM	Kostbera spake:
POEM	16. "A bear saw I enter, | the pillars he broke,
POEM	And he brandished his claws | so that craven we were;
POEM	With his mouth seized he many, | and nought was our might,
POEM	And loud was the tumult, | not little it was."
POEM	
POEM	Hogni spake:
POEM	17. "Now a storm is brewing, | and wild it grows swiftly,
POEM	A dream of an ice-bear | means a gale from the east."
POEM	
POEM	Kostbera spake:
POEM	18. "An eagle I saw flying | from the end through the house,
POEM	Our fate must be bad, | for with blood he sprinkled us;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	From the evil I fear | that 'twas Atli's spirit."
POEM	
POEM	Hogni spake:
POEM	19. "They will slaughter soon, | and so blood do we see,
POEM	Oft oxen it means | when of eagles one dreams;
POEM	True is Atli's heart, | whatever thou dreamest."
POEM	Then silent they were, | and nought further they said.
POEM	
POEM	20. The high-born ones wakened, | and like speech they had,
POEM	Then did Glaumvor tell | how in terror she dreamed,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	. . . . . Gunnar | two roads they should go.
POEM	
POEM	Glaumvor spake:
POEM	21. "A gallows saw I ready, | thou didst go to thy hanging,
POEM	Thy flesh serpents ate, | and yet living I found thee;
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	The gods' doom descended; | now say what it boded."
POEM	* * * * * *
POEM	
POEM	22. "A sword drawn bloody | from thy garments I saw,--
POEM	Such a dream is hard | o a husband to tell,--
POEM	A spear stood, methought, | through thy body thrust,
POEM	And at head and feet | the wolves were howling."
POEM	
POEM	Gunnar spake:
POEM	23. "The hounds are running, | loud their barking is heard,
POEM	Oft hounds' clamor follows | the flying of spears."
POEM	
POEM	Glaumvor spake:
POEM	24. "A river the length | of the hall saw I run,
POEM	Full swiftly it roared, | o'er the benches it swept;
POEM	O'er the feet did it break | of ye brothers twain,
POEM	The water would yield not; | some meaning there was."
POEM	* * * * * *
POEM	
POEM	25. "I dreamed that by night | came dead women hither,
POEM	Sad were their garments, | and thee were they seeking;
POEM	They bade thee come swiftly | forth to their benches,
POEM	And nothing, methinks, | could the Norns avail thee. "
POEM	
POEM	Gunnar spake:
POEM	26. "Too late is thy speaking, | for so is it settled
POEM	From the faring I turn not, | the going is fixed,
POEM	Though likely it is | that our lives shall be short."
POEM	
POEM	27. Then bright shone the morning, | the men all were ready,
POEM	They said, and yet each | would the other hold back;
POEM	Five were the warriors, | and their followers all
POEM	But twice as many,-- | their minds knew not wisdom.
POEM	
POEM	28. Snævar and Solar, | they were sons of Hogni,
POEM	Orkning was he called | who came with the others,
POEM	Blithe was the shield-tree, | the brother of Kostbera;
POEM	The fair-decked ones followed, | till the fjord divided them,
POEM	Full hard did they plead, | but the others would hear not.
POEM	
POEM	29. Then did Glaumvor speak forth, | the wife of Gunnar,
POEM	To Vingi she said | that which wise to her seemed:
POEM	I know not if well | thou requitest our welcome,
POEM	Full ill was thy coming | if evil shall follow.
POEM	
POEM	30. Then did Vingi swear, | and full glib was his speech,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	May giants now take me | if lies I have told ye,
POEM	And the gallows if hostile | thought did I have.
POEM	
POEM	31. Then did Bera speak forth, | and fair was her thought,
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	May ye sail now happy, | and victory have,
POEM	To fare as I bid ye, | may nought your way bar.
POEM	
POEM	32. Then Hogni made answer,-- | dear held he his kin,-
POEM	Take courage, ye wise ones, | whatsoever may come;
POEM	Though many may speak, | yet is evil oft mighty,
POEM	And words avail little | to lead one homeward.
POEM	
POEM	33. They tenderly looked | till each turned on his way,
POEM	Then with changing fate | were their farings divided.
POEM	
POEM	34. Full stoutly they rowed, | and the keel clove asunder,
POEM	Their backs strained at the oars, | and their strength was fierce;
POEM	The oar-loops were burst, | the thole-pins, were broken,
POEM	Nor the ship made they fast | ere from her they fared.
POEM	
POEM	35. Not long was it after-- | the end must I tell--
POEM	That the home they beheld | that Buthli once had;
POEM	Loud the gates resounded | when Hogni smote them;
POEM	
POEM	Vingi spake then a word | that were better unsaid:
POEM	36. "Go ye far from the house, | for false is its entrance,
POEM	Soon shall I burn you, | ye are swiftly smitten;
POEM	I bade ye come fairly, | but falseness was under,
POEM	Now bide ye afar | while your gallows I fashion."
POEM	
POEM	37. Then Hogni made answer, | his heart yielded little,
POEM	And nought did he fear | that his fate held in store:
POEM	Seek not to affright us, | thou shalt seldom succeed;
POEM	If thy words are more, | then the worse grows thy fate.
POEM	
POEM	38. Then Vingi did they smite, | and they sent him to hell,
POEM	With their axes they clove him | while the death rattle came.
POEM	
POEM	39. Atli summoned his men, | in mail-coats they hastened,
POEM	All ready they came, | and between was the courtyard.
POEM	* * * * * *
POEM	
POEM	40. Then came they to words, | and full wrathful they were:
POEM	Long since did we plan | how soon we might slay you.
POEM	
POEM	Hogni spake:
POEM	41. "Little it matters | if long ye have planned it;
POEM	For unarmed do ye wait, | and one have we felled,
POEM	We smote him to hell, | of your host was he once."
POEM	
POEM	42. Then wild was their anger | when all heard his words;
POEM	Their fingers were swift | on their bowstrings to seize,
POEM	Full sharply they shot, | by their shields were they guarded.
POEM	
POEM	43. In the house came the word | how the heroes with out
POEM	Fought in front of the hall; | they heard a thrall tell it;
POEM	Grim then was Guthrun, | the grief when she heard,
POEM	With necklaces fair, | and she flung them all from her,
POEM	(The silver she hurled | so the rings burst asunder.)
POEM	
POEM	44. Then out did she go, | she flung open the doors,
POEM	All fearless she went, | and the guests did she welcome;
POEM	To the Niflungs she went-- | her last greeting it was,--
POEM	In her speech truth was clear, | and much would she speak.
POEM	
POEM	45. "For your safety I sought | that at home ye should stay;
POEM	None escapes his fate, | so ye hither must fare."
POEM	Full wisely she spake, | if yet peace they might win,
POEM	But to nought would they hearken, | and "No" said they all.
POEM	
POEM	46. Then the high-born one saw | that hard was their battle,
POEM	In fierceness of heart | she flung off her mantle;
POEM	Her naked sword grasped she | her kin's lives to guard,
POEM	Not gentle her hands | in the hewing of battle.
POEM	
POEM	47. Then the daughter of Gjuki | two warriors smote down,
POEM	Atli's brother she slew, | and forth then they bore him;
POEM	(So fiercely she fought | that his feet she clove off;)
POEM	Another she smote | so that never he stood,
POEM	To hell did she send him,-- | her hands trembled never.
POEM	
POEM	48. Full wide was the fame | of the battle they fought,
POEM	Twas the greatest of deeds | of the sons of Gjuki;
POEM	Men say that the Niflungs, | while themselves they were living,
POEM	With their swords fought mightily, | mail-coats they sundered,
POEM	And helms did they hew, | as their hearts were fearless.
POEM	
POEM	49. All the morning they fought | until midday shone,
POEM	(All the dusk as well | and the dawning of day,)
POEM	When the battle was ended, | the field flowed with blood;
POEM	Ere they fell, eighteen | of their foemen were slain,
POEM	By the two sons of Bera | and her brother as well.
POEM	
POEM	50. Then the warrior spake, | and wild was his anger:
POEM	This is evil to see, | and thy doing is all;
POEM	Once we were thirty, | we thanes, keen for battle,
POEM	Now eleven are left, | and great is our lack.
POEM	
POEM	51. There were five of us brothers | when Buthli we lost,
POEM	Now Hel has the half, | and two smitten lie here;
POEM	A great kinship had I,-- | the truth may I hide not,--
POEM	From a wife bringing slaughter | small joy could I win.
POEM	
POEM	52. We lay seldom together | since to me thou wast given,
POEM	Now my kin all are gone, | of my gold am I robbed;
POEM	Nay, and worst, thou didst send | my sister to hell."
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	53. "Hear me now, Atli! | the first evil was thine;
POEM	My mother didst thou take, | and for gold didst murder her,
POEM	My sister's daughter | thou didst starve in a prison.
POEM	A jest does it seem | that thy sorrow thou tellest,
POEM	And good do I find it | that grief to thee comes."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	54. "Go now, ye warriors, | and make greater the grief
POEM	Of the woman so fair, | for fain would I see it;
POEM	So fierce be thy warring | that Guthrun shall weep,
POEM	I would gladly behold | her happiness lost.
POEM	
POEM	55. "Seize ye now Hogni, | and with knives shall ye hew him,
POEM	His heart shall ye cut out, | this haste ye to do;
POEM	And grim-hearted Gunnar | shall ye bind on the gallows,
POEM	Swift shall ye do it, | to serpents now cast him."
POEM	
POEM	Hogni spake:
POEM	56. "Do now as thou wilt, | for glad I await it,
POEM	Brave shalt thou find me, | I have faced worse before;
POEM	We held thee at bay | while whole we were fighting,
POEM	Now with wounds are we spent, | so thy will canst thou work."
POEM	
POEM	57. Then did Beiti speak, | he was Atli's steward:
POEM	Let us seize now Hjalli, | and Hogni spare we!
POEM	Let us fell the sluggard, | he is fit for death,
POEM	He has lived too long, | and lazy men call him.
POEM	
POEM	58. Afraid was the pot-watcher, | he fled here and yon,
POEM	And crazed with his terror | he climbed in the corners:
POEM	Ill for me is this fighting, | if I pay for your fierceness,
POEM	And sad is the day | to die leaving my swine
POEM	And all the fair victuals | that of old did I have.
POEM	
POEM	59. They seized Buthli's cook, | and they came with the knife,
POEM	The frightened thrall howled | ere the edge did he feel;
POEM	He was willing, he cried, | to dung well the court yard,
POEM	Do the basest of work, | if spare him they would;
POEM	Full happy were Hjalli | if his life he might have.
POEM	
POEM	60. Then fain was Hogni-- | there are few would do thus--
POEM	To beg for the slave | that safe hence he should go;
POEM	I would find it far better | this knife-play to feel,
POEM	Why must we all hark | to this howling longer?
POEM	
POEM	61. Then the brave one they seized; | to the warriors bold
POEM	No chance was there left | to delay his fate longer;
POEM	Loud did Hogni laugh, | all the sons of day heard him,
POEM	So valiant he was | that well he could suffer.
POEM	* * * * * *
POEM	
POEM	62. A harp Gunnar seized, | with his toes he smote it
POEM	So well did he strike | that the women all wept,
POEM	And the men, when clear | they heard it, lamented;
POEM	Full noble was his song, | the rafters burst asunder.
POEM	
POEM	63. Then the heroes died | ere the day was yet come;
POEM	Their fame did they leave | ever lofty to live.
POEM	. . . . . . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	64. Full mighty seemed Atli | as o'er them he stood,
POEM	The wise one he blamed, | and his words reproached her:
POEM	It is morning, Guthrun; | now thy dear ones dost miss,
POEM	But the blame is part thine | that thus it has chanced.
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	65. "Thou art joyous, Atli, | for of evil thou tellest,
POEM	But sorrow is thine | if thou mightest all see;
POEM	Thy heritage heavy | here can I tell thee,
POEM	Sorrow never thou losest | unless I shall die."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	66. "Not free of guilt am I; | a way shall I find
POEM	That is better by far,-- | oft the fairest we shunned;--
POEM	With slaves I console thee, | with gems fair to see,
POEM	And with silver snow-white, | as thyself thou shalt choose."
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	67. "No hope shall this give thee, | thy gifts I shall take not,
POEM	Requital I spurned | when my sorrows were smaller;
POEM	Once grim did I seem, | but now greater my grimness,
POEM	There was nought seemed too hard | while Hogni was living.
POEM	
POEM	68. "Our childhood did we have | in a single house,
POEM	We played many a game, | in the grove did we grow;
POEM	Then did Grimhild give us | gold and necklaces,
POEM	Thou shalt ne'er make amends | for my brother's murder,
POEM	Nor ever shalt win me | to think it was well.
POEM	
POEM	69. "But the fierceness of men | rules the fate of women,
POEM	The tree-top bows low | if bereft of its leaves,
POEM	The tree bends over | if the roots are cleft under it;
POEM	Now mayest thou, Atli, | o'er all things here rule."
POEM	
POEM	70. Full heedless the warrior | was that he trusted her,
POEM	So clear was her guile | if on guard he had been;
POEM	But crafty was Guthrun, | with cunning she spake,
POEM	Her glance she made pleasant, | with two shields she played.
POEM	
POEM	71. The beer then she brought | for her brothers' death feast,
POEM	And a feast Atli made | for his followers dead
POEM	No more did they speak, | the mead was made ready,
POEM	Soon the men were gathered | with mighty uproar.
POEM	
POEM	72. Thus bitterly planned she, | and Buthli's race threatened,
POEM	And terrible vengeance | on her husband would take;
POEM	The little ones called she, | on a block she laid them;
POEM	Afraid were the proud ones, | but their tears did not fall;
POEM	To their mother's arms went they, | and asked what she would.
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	73. "Nay, ask me no more! | You both shall I murder,
POEM	For long have I wished | your lives to steal from you.
POEM	
POEM	The boys spake:
POEM	Slay thy boys as thou wilt, | for no one may bar it,
POEM	Short the angry one's peace | if all thou shalt do.
POEM	
POEM	74. Then the grim one slew both | of the brothers young,
POEM	Full hard was her deed | when their heads she smote off;
POEM	Fain was Atli to know | whither now they were gone,
POEM	The boys from their sport, | for nowhere he spied them.
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	75. "My fate shall I seek, | all to Atli saying,
POEM	The daughter of Grimhild | the deed from thee hides not;
POEM	No joy thou hast, Atli, | if all thou shalt hear,
POEM	Great sorrow didst wake | when my brothers thou slewest.
POEM	
POEM	76. '1 have seldom slept | since the hour they were slain,
POEM	Baleful were my threats, | now I bid thee recall them;
POEM	Thou didst say it was morning,-- | too well I remember,--
POEM	Now is evening come, | and this question thou askest.
POEM	
POEM	77. "Now both of thy sons | thou hast lost . . . .
POEM	. . . . . | as thou never shouldst do;
POEM	The skulls of thy boys | thou as beer-cups didst have,
POEM	And the draught that I made thee | was mixed with their blood.
POEM	
POEM	78. 'I cut out their hearts, | on a spit I cooked them,
POEM	I came to thee with them, | and calf's flesh I called them;
POEM	Alone didst thou eat them, | nor any didst leave,
POEM	Thou didst greedily bite, | and thy teeth were busy.
POEM	
POEM	79. "Of thy sons now thou knowest; | few suffer more sorrow;
POEM	My guilt have I told, | fame it never shall give me."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	80. "Grim wast thou, Guthrun, | in so grievous a deed,
POEM	My draught with the blood | of thy boys to mingle;
POEM	Thou hast slain thine own kin, | most ill it be seemed thee,
POEM	And little for me | twixt my sorrows thou leavest."
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	81. "Still more would I seek | to slay thee thyself,
POEM	Enough ill comes seldom | to such as thou art;
POEM	Thou didst folly of old, | such that no one shall find
POEM	In the whole world of men | a match for such madness.
POEM	Now this that of late | we learned hast thou added,
POEM	Great evil hast grasped, | and thine own death feast made."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	82. "With fire shall they burn thee, | and first shall they stone thee,
POEM	So then hast thou earned | what thou ever hast sought for."
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	Such woes for thyself | shalt thou say in the morning,
POEM	From a finer death I | to another light fare.
POEM	
POEM	83. Together they sat | and full grim were their thoughts,
POEM	Unfriendly their words, | and no joy either found;
POEM	In Hniflung grew hatred, | great plans did he have,
POEM	To Guthrun his anger | against Atli was told.
POEM	
POEM	84. To her heart came ever | the fate of Hogni,
POEM	She told him 'twere well | if he vengeance should win;
POEM	So was Atli slain,-- | 'twas not slow to await,--
POEM	Hogni's son slew him, | and Guthrun herself.
POEM	
POEM	85. Then the warrior spake, | as from slumber he wakened,
POEM	Soon he knew for his wounds | would the bandage do nought:
POEM	Now the truth shalt thou say: | who has slain Buthli's son?
POEM	Full sore am I smitten, | nor hope can I see.
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	86. "Ne'er her deed from thee hides | the daughter of Grimhild,
POEM	I own to the guilt | that is ending thy life,
POEM	And the son of Hogni; | 'tis so thy wounds bleed."
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	To murder hast thou fared, | though foul it must seem;
POEM	Ill thy friend to betray | who trusted thee well.
POEM	
POEM	87. Not glad went I hence | thy hand to seek, Guthrun,
POEM	In thy widowhood famed, | but haughty men found thee;
POEM	My belief did not lie, | as now we have learned;
POEM	I brought thee home hither, | and a host of men with us.
POEM	
POEM	88. "Most noble was all | when of old we journeyed,
POEM	Great honor did we have | of heroes full worthy;
POEM	Of cattle had we plenty, | and greatly we prospered,
POEM	Mighty was our wealth, | and many received it.
POEM	
POEM	89. "To the famed one as bride-gift | I gave jewels fair,
POEM	I gave thirty slaves, | and handmaidens seven;
POEM	There was honor in such gifts, | yet the silver was greater.
POEM	
POEM	90. "But all to thee was | as if nought it were worth,
POEM	While the land lay before thee | that Buthli had left me;
POEM	Thou in secret didst work | so the treasure I won not;
POEM	My mother full oft | to sit weeping didst make,
POEM	No wedded joy found I | in fullness of heart."
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	91. "Thou liest now, Atli, | though little I heed it;
POEM	If I seldom was kindly, | full cruel wast thou;
POEM	Ye brothers fought young, | quarrels brought you to battle,
POEM	And half went to hell | of the sons of thy house,
POEM	And all was destroyed | that should e'er have done good.
POEM	
POEM	92. "My two brothers and I | were bold in our thoughts,
POEM	From the land we went forth, | with Sigurth we fared;
POEM	Full swiftly we sailed, | each one steering his ship,
POEM	So our fate sought we e'er | till we came to the East.
POEM	
POEM	93. "First the king did we slay, | and the land we seized,
POEM	The princes did us service, | for such was their fear;
POEM	From the forest we called | them we fain would have guiltless,
POEM	And rich made we many | who of all were bereft.
POEM	
POEM	94. "Slain was the Hun-king, | soon happiness vanished,
POEM	In her grief the widow | so young sat weeping;
POEM	Yet worse seemed the sorrow | to seek Atli's house,
POEM	A hero was my husband, | and hard was his loss.
POEM	
POEM	95. "From the Thing thou camst never, | for thus have we heard,
POEM	Having won in thy quarrels, | or warriors smitten;
POEM	Full yielding thou wast, | never firm was thy will,
POEM	In silence didst suffer, | . . . . .
POEM	
POEM	Atli spake:
POEM	96. "Thou liest now, Guthrun, | but little of good
POEM	Will it bring to either, | for all have we lost;
POEM	But, Guthrun, yet once | be thou kindly of will,
POEM	For the honor of both, | when forth I am home."
POEM	
POEM	Guthrun spake:
POEM	97. "A ship will I buy, | and a bright-hued coffin,
POEM	I will wax well the shroud | to wind round thy body,
POEM	For all will I care | as if dear were we ever."
POEM	
POEM	98. Then did Atli die, | and his heirs' grief doubled;
POEM	The high-born one did | as to him she had promised;
POEM	Then sought Guthrun the wise | to go to her death,
POEM	But for days did she wait, | and 'twas long ere she died.
POEM	
POEM	99. Full happy shall he be | who such offspring has,
POEM	Or children so gallant, | as Gjuki begot;
POEM	Forever shall live, | and in lands far and wide,
POEM	Their valor heroic | wherever men hear it.
